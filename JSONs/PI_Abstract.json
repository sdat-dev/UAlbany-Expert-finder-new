    "john berglund": "statement of work: berglund lab. johnson ro1.  our lab will be responsible for experiments proposed in aim 3. specifically, we will determine if potential congenital myotonic dystrophy (cdm) splicing events respond to mbnl1 concentration gradients using our dosing cell lines. we will compare the characteristics of the cdm events to dm1 events we have previously studied (wagner et al. 2016) and continue to study. to determine the mechanisms that make splicing events unique to cdm we will use minigenes and mutagenesis to identify motifs important in this process. understanding the behavior of these splicing events (for example - does an event respond over a shallow or broad concentration range of mbnl1) is important to determine the suitability of these events as biomarkers for cdm.    in collaboration, we will calculate the mbnl protein available or free to regulate splicing (inferred mbnl) from the rna-seq data from cdm and control samples (aim 1). the inferred mbnl measurement correlates with the severity of mis-splicing and we used it to identify biomarkers from 44 dm1 patient rna-seq samples (wagner et al. 2016). we   expect mbnl inferred to be on the lower spectrum for cdm compared to the dm1 patients. comparing inferred mbnl in cdm and dm1 samples will provide an approach for determining the role of mbnl sequestration in cdm. with our recent work on dm1, we are in a unique position to help you accomplish your research goals. i'm excited to see the outcome of these experiments.  wagner sd, struck aj, gupta r, farnsworth dr, mahady

28;12(9):e1006316. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006316. pmcid: pmc5082313      canonical translation results in the expression of a protein from a single reading frame of a transcript using  the aug  start  codon.  non-canonical  translation,  such  as  internal  ribosome  entry  site  (ires)  driven   translation used by extensively by viruses, utilize a variety of non-traditional methods for translation initiation.   the  recently  discovered  repeat  associated  non-aug  (ran)  translation  is  one  of  these  non-canonical  processes. ran translation is initiated in multiple reading frames across a microsatellite repeat expansion  in the absence of aug- or aug-like start codons. despite a growing role in a large number of diseases, the  underlying molecular mechanism of ran translation remain unclear. rna structure does plays a key role in  ran translation and other forms on non-canonical translation, yet our knowledge of how structural features  facilitate translation is limited. to examine the role of rna structure in non-canonical translation, i screened  a series of long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) with predicted rna structures like ran and ires sequences  for their ability to support translation across multiple frames. interestingly this structure forward approach  identified  several  sequences  that  support  non-canonical  translation  in  multiple  reading  frames  in  the   absence of both repeat expansions and aug-start codons. these data suggest a broader set of processes  than  previously  anticipated by  which  rna  transcripts  can undergo multi-frame translation  (mft).  the  overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the biological, disease and therapeutic implications of multi- frame translation (mft). in  this  proposal,  i  will  determine the cellular rna structures, protein factors and  cellular networks that facilitate non-canonical multi-frame translation, with a focus on their contributions to  disease pathogenesis. together this research will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of mft, improve our  understanding of its role in biology and disease as well as uncover aspects of mft that are suitable targets  for therapeutic intervention.        developing the center for myotonic dystrophy – stage 3 funding (renewal)    project abstract  the rna institute at the state university of new york at albany (suny albany) has significantly advanced plans for the  development of a center of excellence for myotonic dystrophy. this center will serve as a hub for research, education, and  workforce  development  for myotonic dystrophy  (dm)  and  other  repeat  expansion  diseases.  our  goal  is  to  develop  an   internationally   recognized   nexus   for   scientific   discovery,   therapeutic   development   and   workforce   development    opportunities  in dm  and  the  repeat  expansion  field.  during  the  previous  stage  2  funding  period  (7/  1/2021-  6/30/2022),  marigold funds supported: 1) rna summer fellows program, in which trainees learn about dm and use dm1   datasets to  understand bioinformatics; 2) research by institute postdoctoral and graduate fellows toward understanding the mechanism  of dm and building new therapeutic approaches; 3) collaborative projects with other institute faculty to expand the scope  of dm research into novel areas of rna research, including epitranscriptomics.  the rna institute, under the direction of  dr. andy berglund, has also made significant progress on engaging state and federal leaders to support funding for dm  research and the center for myotonic dystrophy. based on our progression and strong engagement in dm research, we are  hereby  requesting  renewal  in  the  amount  of  $200,000  towards  stage  3 funding  for  additional research, education, and  workforce development in support of the center creation.  these funds will be used to support two main research avenues:  (1) support for two promising early-stage investigators (esi) to expanding the base of dm researchers at the rna institute;  and (2) several promising but unfunded research projects with potential impact to dm patients, including our dm biomarker  and transcriptomic exercise projects. in addition to these research avenues, we will continue with engaging in educational  and workforce development opportunities that advance research and awareness of dm. these combined efforts are designed  expand and promote dm research, education ,and workforce development efforts at the local, state, federal and international  levels with the ultimate goal of developing the rna institute’s center for myotonic dystrophy.      scope: this congressionally directed spending (cds) construction project, funded through the health resources and services administration's office of federal assistance management (ofam), is for the purchase of a next generation rna technology package consisting entirely of three pieces of moveable equipment. this equipment will support research, training, and workforce development at the rna institute and will make these important tools available to researchers from across the capital region and at the state, national, and international level. this equipment-only purchase proposal seeks to acquire advanced instrumentation for the rna institute that are based on technologies that have revolutionized the study of biology and human health. in the hands of the researchers of the rna institute, this equipment will help to accelerate research program and innovation that will improve health outcomes, aid in the training of a skilled biomedical workforce, and contribute to innovative, high-value programs in new york's tech valley.    pathogen genomics center of excellence strategy

pathogens threats.      project summary  myotonic dystrophy (dm), the leading cause of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, is a member of  a family of 50 +  diseases caused by the expansion of gene-specific microsatellite repeats.  amongst this family, dm is one of the most complex multi-systemic disorders and presents with  a host of symptoms including myotonia, muscle weakness, cardiac conduction defects, excess  daytime sleepiness and cognitive dysfunction.  myotonic dystrophy type 1 (dm1) is caused by a  ctg repeat expansion in the 3’ utr of the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (dmpk) gene,  which results in an rna gain-of- function (gof) mechanism induced by expansion rnas. the  biological signature of dm1 occurs when the expanded rnas sequester rna binding proteins  (rbps) leading to dysregulated rna splicing and directly linked with disease features such as  insulin resistance and myotonia.  while the reduction of the expanded rnas is an attractive  therapeutic target, there are no current effective treatment options, and many small molecules  with potential in dm are toxic with sub-optimal delivery properties.  to address this large unmet  demand and the dearth of safe effective compounds, we utilized a large library of natural  products and identified through a screening process that included patient-derived cells, the  flavonoid, isoquercetin, as a promising therapeutic candidate.  isoquercetin is    plant-based  flavonol found in appreciable quantities in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains.  utilizing cell culture and animal models, we have demonstrated that isoquercetin can rescue  multiple dm1 hallmark events, including mis-splicing and myotonia, with no obvious toxicity,  making it an ideal candidate for further clinical testing  the proposed study is conducted in two phases and will confirm the biological effects of  isoquercetin in  dm1 patients, address optimal dosage and bioavailability as well as identify  biological signatures and biomarkers that reflect disease relevant dm1 clinical outcomes. this  information is critical for conducting future isoquercetin clinical trials in dm patients. in r61  phase, escalating supplement doses of 1000, 2000, and 4000 mg/day will be tested in cohorts  of 8 participants for each dose for a period of 60-day.  the outcome of the r61 phase will  determine the feasibility of r33 phase, which if milestones are met, will evaluate 30 dm1  patients, who will be randomized to receive either placebo or a selected isoquercetin dose for a  period of 12 months. in both r61 and r33 phases, all subjects will be clinically characterized  using validate patient-reported outcomes, quantitative muscle strength assessments and  molecular disease signatures. in both phases, all participants will be required to go on a low  isoquercetin diet for a washout period of 7 days prior to program with blood samples taken  before washout to determine baseline dietary levels of flavonoids for each participant. blood,  muscle biopsies and buccal swabs will be taken at program start and end to measure biological  signatures, isoquercetin levels, markers of inflammation and blood profiles to assess the  bioavailability.  results from these r61/r33 studies will provide critical information on biological  endpoints, bioavailability, and isoquercetin dosage required to carry out large clinical trials  examining the efficacy of isoquercetin in  dm1 patients and potentially other repeat expansion  disorders.      project abstract  myotonic dystrophy type 2 (dm2) is a form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, characterized by a complex  multisystemic involvement that includes myotonia, muscle weakness and wasting, cardiac dysfunction, cataracts, insulin  resistance, and cognitive impairment. the molecular basis for dm2 is the expansion of a cctg repeat tract in intron 1 of  the cchc-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein (cnbp) gene. dm2 shares an rna gain-of-function pathogenic  mechanism with dm type 1 (dm1), which is caused by a ctg expansion in an unrelated gene. transcription of these  repeat expansions form characteristic ribonuclear rna foci that sequester and disrupt the function of the muscleblind- like (mbnl) family of rna-binding proteins. mbnl sequestration causes defects in multiple downstream processes,  including many alternative splicing defects that can be directly linked to disease features, such as myotonia, cardiac  defects, and insulin resistance.  while both forms of dm share overlapping pathogenic mechanisms, they possess distinct molecular and clinical  features. clinically, dm2 has a later onset than dm1, has no congenital form like dm1, and displays proximal muscle  wasting. at the molecular level, cnbp is more highly expressed than dmpk, dm2 has larger intronic ccug expansions  (>10,000 repeats) than the dm1 (~5000 repeats), and dm2 causes intron retention not seen in dm1. the rna binding  fox (rbfox) proteins bind and colocalize with ccug rna foci, but not the dm1 cug rna foci. interestingly, despite a  potentially higher toxic rna load in dm2, the degree of mis-splicing appears similar to, or less severe than in dm.  unfortunately, while there are many models and considerable therapeutic focus for dm1, similar model systems and  efforts for dm2 have been limited, hampering research and therapeutic development for this disease.  this project brings together an academic expert in myotonic dystrophy and rna splicing (andy berglund, director of  ualbany’s the rna institute) with innovative leaders in the biotechnology industry (lucy abgaryan co-founder & ceo  and gor sarkisyan co-founder & cso of grittgene therapeutics).  grittgene therapeutics (pis: lucy

patient-derived biological materials (tissues & cells) and data.   characterized biological resources and experimental data from the project will be made available to grittgene  therapeutics to pursue therapeutic research and development.  university at albany’s rna institute (pi: andy berglund, phd) is a leading new york state academic institution with a  mission to advance rna research and train

    "hany elgala": "  project summary the ultimate goal of the proposed work is to revolutionize the wireless networks in warehouses for enabling the operation of future parcel sortation systems. in the entire process of supply chain in e-commerce, parcel sortation is always a major step. a robotic sorting system automates this process, greatly reduces the man- ual demands in the sorting process and improves the accuracy rate, and eventually boosts the operational efficiency by orders of magnitude. the existing sorting robots rely on collision avoidance and distributed leaning algorithms to identify the path from the parcel pickup point to the drop-off point. accordingly, a wireless network that serves simultaneous wireless communication and real-time tracking of robots, while offering wide-coverage, scalability in the number of robots and affordability compared to existing solutions, will revolutionize the future of warehousing. this project proposes a new holistic solution to achieve close- to-optimal path planning with large-scale deployment of robots. our approach enables an edge computing based graph neural network (gnn) framework through the utilization of retro-reflector based visible light communication (retro-vlc) and positioning, where zero-delay and centimeter-level robot tracking is sup- ported under a single luminaire. the proposed retro-vlc based path planning system has unique features: 1) the sequential communication exchange among robots in gnn are minimized to implement a highly salable multi-robot system, 2) the indoor lighting infrastructure is used to sustain a dominant line-of-sight (los) between the light access points (aps) and the robots, and 3) the retro-reflected light offers real-time, low-complexity, and location signature-embedded uplinks between multiple robots and the light aps. keywords:multi-robot path planning; real-time tracking; latency-constrained graph neural network; large-scale optical retro-reflecting networks; multiple access techniques; warehouse wireless networks. intellectual merit:the proposed research will develop a new gnn enabled wireless framework for connecting and tracking large amount of visible light retro-reflector based tags. the project is divided into three inter-related thrust areas. in the first thrust, a novel edge computing framework is proposed to minimize the sequential communication exchange among robots, which brings close-to-optimal path planning to reality. in the second thrust, the concept of retro-vlc using modulating retro-reflector (mrr) tags mounted on individual robots is proposed. the novel pixelated-mrr (p-mrr) tag allows for the first time, a large-scale orthogonal multiple-access optical retro-reflecting system based on an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (ofdma) framework and fully synchronized p-mrr tags. the location signature characterization and spectral-cooperative joint communication and positioning solution are the main focuses in the third thrust, where composite retro-reflected waveforms enable such dual functionality without scarifying spectrum resources. the integration of three thrusts and experimental validation for channel characterization, hardware and algorithm designs are highlighted in the evaluation plan. broader impacts:the proposed research will allow novel wireless communication and tracking of a large-scale network of robots toward realizing the vision of smart spaces such as warehouses. it will revo- lutionize warehouses to meet the increasing demand brought by the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic. the generated ns-3 simulation modules will be the first tool for modeling such a network. the proposed edu- cational activities complement the proposed research, such as integrating the research results into courses and mentoring of underrepresented undergraduate students. new mexico tech (nmt) is a hispanic serv- ing institution (hsi) with 17% enrolled graduate students from under-represented groups (i.e., hispanic, american indian, african american, and native hawaiian). the pis will recruit graduate students from under-represented groups. the project will impact industry and standards (ieee 802.15.7) through demon- stration of results with the help of our industrial partner genworx.",

influenza, and aids. at the  molecular level, macromolecular interactions play a critical role in determining the functioning of these  pathogens and have developed into a critical pathway in the drug development pipeline. the landscape of  protein-protein interactions can now be better understood with the help of current computational research,  which has produced qualitative tools and public data servers for researchers to curate and better  comprehend protein- protein interaction predictions. bioinformatics analytic capacity is however lagging  behind data generation capacity and existing software packages cannot be retooled, amenable to high- performance computing requirements. moreover, by treating all proteins from various pathogens alike,  this huge array of software platforms and computational resources are hindered by the generality of the  issue domain, resulting in lower predictive power. this proposal aims to create a structure involving  mathematics topological tools, machine learning models, and specialized prediction systems for protein- protein interaction predictions of diverse organisms (host and pathogens). in order to better understand  and predict protein-protein interactions, we will develop and implement high-performance computing  integrated with a sustainable machine learning model with input features gotten from novel topological data  analysis algorithms implemented to capture such features from the 3d structure surface of the protein. we  will test our approach on the plasmodium falciparum (pf) pathogen dataset with an impact expected to  transcend to other pathogens to show the robustness of our approach. we proposed to develop and  implement scalable and distributed machine learning models able to handle large and evolving  bioinformatics datasets. keywords: protein-protein interaction; machine learning; high performance  computing; topological data analysis; malaria.    intellectual merit:  we will develop a range of algorithms for improved and systematic research into protein-protein inter-  actions. these algorithms will advance the state-of-the-art for topology approaches embedded into  understanding features present on the surface of 3d structures of proteins and how this information leads  towards novel machine learning models able to scale to high-performance computing systems. deep  neural networks which include dnn architectures with thick non-linear and embedding layers are proposed  and new hierarchical conditional variational autoencoders will be developed. we develop a novel strategy  that utilizes hpc settings by automating the search for optimal neural network topologies per protein and  organ- ism class. our approaches will significantly impact protein research in different sectors from  exposing new functions to understanding binding interactions, affinity, poses, and inherent association with  other proteins.     broader impacts:  this proposal has great potential social benefits including speeding up the drug discovery research  pipeline. this proposal paves the path for bringing the recent advances in topological data analysis  (tda), deep learning, and hpc, to facilitate vaccine development for a variety of diseases (e.g., covid19,  malaria, and hiv). the research agenda includes the development of robust algorithms that have the  potential to not only impact the proposed application domain but also a wide variety of applications  including broadening research on neglected diseases due to the uniqueness of the pathogens and  understanding host-pathogen interactions. the project has an integrated research and education plan.  this plan includes course development for cross-disciplinary undergraduate and graduate levels,  leveraging the experimental platform and research results. outreach activities will contain disseminating  bioinformatics, machine learning, and high- performance computing topics, tools, and modules into k-12  and stem activities. mentoring, training, and research opportunities will be provided for graduate,  undergraduate, and high school students. more importantly, this project will open the doors for international  engagement via working with biologists and scientists in africa to gather crucial african biological data to  help provide computational tools for drug discovery.  the computational structural bioinformatics workshop (csbw) is a single-track workshop featuring peer-reviewed works on advances in computational methods in structural biology. understanding the fundamental role of protein and nucleotide structures in life processes involves many computational challenges and opportunities. new experimental and computational techniques that generate and use large amounts of structural data have enabled novel analysis approaches, leading to an increased understanding of different biophysical phenomena. csbw provides a forum for discussion of state-of-the-art computational approaches related to protein structure discovery and analysis. the specific goals of the workshop are threefold:  discuss and share the most recent methods in the computational structural bioinformatics community.  provide a forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present ongoing work in the form of manuscripts and posters, in an stimulating and welcoming environment.  exchange project ideas and facilitate collaborations across research groups and disciplines.  structural bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field, and csbw connects scientists who work on this topic through the lens of various academic areas, such as computer science, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and computational biology. topics covered in csbw are at the forefront of research in structural biology and include (but not limited to):  structure representation, prediction, and alignment  biomolecular interaction and docking  molecular dynamics simulations  biomolecular graphics  coarse-grained modeling  data mining of structural data  structural genomics  optimization in structural problems  high-performance computing in modeling  graph theory applied to structural problems  structure-based drug design  this year, as conferences return to in-person attendance, we are seeking partial travel support for student presenters at csbw. we expect to hold a full-day workshop as in previous years, with oral presentations of peer-reviewed papers and posters, a keynote talk, and career and hot-topics panel discussions. csbw also offers a unique networking opportunity among researchers in computational structural bioinformatics. its small setting allows for open discussion of ideas, and students and postdocs benefit immensely from conversations with senior researchers in a welcoming environment. on a personal note, pi jacobson's participation at csbw 2017 as a postdoc enabled her to network with senior scientists in her field, who later provided invaluable support and guidance as she applied for faculty positions. this would not have been possible without a workshop environment where every attendee has a chance to talk at length with each other and form professional bonds.    overview: the aim of this proposal is to produce new motion planning architecture with topology rich proper- ties. these properties include the ability to identify critical and priority regions of the environment, the density of samples needed to produce a feasible roadmap and a method that is robust un- der continuous deformations of the environment. morse theory is a well known tool for capturing topology properties but is notorious for failing computationally in high dimension spaces. our pro- posal will take a step towards an advanced framework that will enable efficient planning in high dimension spaces including presence of dynamic and complex obstacles.  one outcome will be significant improvement of robot path planning which will enhance both robot and human safety and remove/reduce the need for re-computation in the presence of dynamic obstacles.   these algorithms for robot navigation and manipulation in structured and unstructured environments are applicable in such diverse research domains as protein folding in biology, manufacturing and as- sembly,  service robots in warehouses,  and self-driving car initiatives.   this project will provide very universal tools that address such classical issues in motion planning as path and trajectory planning near medial axes that is related to robot safety. the backbone of this methodology draws from recent advances in applied topology based on discrete morse theory.  while the use of morse theory in robotics is established, all such use has been restricted to the classical smooth theory with all the implied drawbacks such as the need of approximation and the related need of expensive updates in a changing environment. in contrast, discrete morse theory is a combinatorial theory that is expressly amenable to computation and has a good number of implementations.  the proposed method provides a robust representation of the free space, completely invariant under continuous deformations of the environment.  other computational  advantages  come  from  the  coordinate-free  nature  of  our  approach,  agnostic  to any bounds on the dimension of the free space.  keywords:  discrete morse theory; vietoris-rips complex; topological data analysis; motion planning; medial axis; dynamic environment. intellectual merit: this new motion planning framework will be designed from a novel combination of topology meth- ods such as discrete morse theory and motion planning primitives like the sampling based planning approach and technique.  this package will be a powerful tool for robot path planning in unstruc- tured and dynamic environments. the algorithms developed can be adapted to work with various robot types, complexity and workspace to significantly improve their performance and accuracy, thus making them more versatile in their applicability. this new approach lends itself excellently to robot safety due to the unique use of discrete morse theory to generate critical points in the plan- ning space and a new way to calculate the medial axis.  discrete morse theory is a powerful new topological method with a fantastic track record solving long-standing problems in data science and in pure mathematics fields such as geometric group theory. broader impacts: the  scientific  impact  of  this  research  direction  includes  a  better  appreciation  and  utilization  of geometry and topology algorithms for real-time and online planning.  due to the interdisciplinary nature, this research has the potential to bridge the gap between research that is theory-heavy (data topology) to research with a high application content (robotics and motion planning).  this project will cater to attracting student into stem-related field through a variety of workshops that will be introduced at women conferences and high school initiatives the pi’s are involved in at the university at albany.   pi ekenna is involved in stem day at university at albany which invites high school females from neighboring high schools and plans to have a workshop showcasing what better motion planning algorithms (which this research aims to achieve) can do.  pi ekenna has experience organizing women leadership forums at various workshops and conferences e.g., icra women in robotics forum and the acm-w leadership series at texas a & m university.  pi goldfarb is a leading developer of the new master of science program in data science in the mathematics and statistics department.  the program grew from 8 students in fall 2017 to 82 in fall 2020.  pi goldfarb is a co-organizer of the “summer of tda” internship program at the air force research laboratory, dayton, oh, in collaboration with afrl, wright state, and stanford.",

    "craig ferguson": "from three substantial nasa/gewex-supported u.s. regional hydroclimate project scoping workshops over the past 10-years (trace: 2011; nawp:2012; na rhp: 2016) emerged a single, consistent community consensus: a long-term scalable testbed network with uniform and comprehensive instrumentation of the land-atmosphere continuum-from bedrock to boundary layer-is needed to enhance hydrological modeling. land-atmosphere coupling is a major challenge in multiple disciplines. and it cannot be sufficiently addressed through traditional limited-area/duration and univariate (i.e., snow or soil moisture) airborne and ground calibration/validation campaigns. such campaigns are constrained in their representativeness by local geography, topography, and ecology compounded by hydroclimatic variability (e.g., weather regimes, vegetation dynamics).   this proposal is for funding of a working group to design a land-atmosphere observing testbed that will address the needs of the broad ecohydrological remote sensing, modeling and forecasting communities. the testbed will: 1) meet the calibration/validation needs of nasa's current and future (next decadal) earth observing missions and models, assess uncertainty, including scaling rule assessments; 2) fill observational gaps deemed critical to addressing open process-related science questions; and 3) increase the overall application of nasa data and models towards addressing priority science questions of the day across the interdisciplinary earth system modeling community. the proposal team comprises a core of members from the gewex global land atmosphere system study (glass) panel, which is tasked with advancing development of hydrological models in the context of coupled earth system models. the core of land-atmospheric experts is complimented by additional experts in terrestrial warm- and cold season hydrology, surface biology and geology, boundary layer and synoptic/dynamic meteorology and land data assimilation. importantly, several team members have expertise in hydrometeorological and flux instrumentation, nasa calibration/validation, and are active in relevant nasa mission (i.e., smap, nisar, sbg, pbl incubator) and modeling (i.e., geos, nu-wrf, lis) activities.  the requested funding will be used over a period of 18-months to: 1) review current and future nasa observing and modeling capabilities in the context of ecohydrological modeling; 2) synthesize the observational gaps needed to constrain land-only and earth system models at hyper resolution; 3) solicit suitability/tradeoff reports on reference facilities (e.g., arm-sgp, neon, nsf czo, cuahsi) preferred by one research community/nasa program (e.g., ecosystem scientists) from members of an alternate research community (e.g., hydrologists); 4) draft a white paper that includes preliminary siting, instrumental specifications, and scientific justification for the testbed; 5) solicit community feedback on the draft white paper via: a public comment period online, a town hall meeting at agu or similar conference, and paid reviews from expert instrumentalists, process-level scientists, and operational weather and climate modelers; and 6) revision and publication of the white paper. first, the team will design a network that addresses local-remote land-atmosphere interactions. then, the team will explore how core land-atmosphere instrumentation at each site could be augmented to address a different, locally-relevant process, such as: managed agriculture (southwest u.s.), snow/soil moisture (rocky mountains), riparian ecology (southern great plains), groundwater-atmosphere interactions (northern great plains). within the overarching scope of land-atmosphere interactions, the testbed is expected to capture spatio-temporal variability of: soil texture, snow, soil moisture, vegetation and carbon dynamics, groundwater, streamflow, and precipitation. the overall goal is to improve and enhance the applicability of nasa products in the hydrologic community.    summary  quantifying the impact of deforestation on local and regional hydroclimates in alberta using nu-wrf  the boreal forest located in alberta canada are disappearing at a rate faster than the amazon rain forest. the major cause behind this deforestation is the growing demand for energy and land for the growing cities in canada. at the beginning of this century, just 25% of alberta was disturbed by agriculture, communities, and other developments. now the total has reached 30% and most of the disturbance is caused by the logging industry. the change in the land cover/use in the location has not only affected the ecosystem but also the hydroclimate of this location. previous studies have shown that afternoon precipitation has a high sensitivity to land-cover change. the main objective of this proposal is to understand the impact of rapid land use/cover change in regional hydroclimates of alberta. the proposed study will use modeling and observational approach to see the impact of land cover/use change in the regional and local hydroclimate of alberta. at first, we will find whether the dynamic vegetation model adds realism to represent the regeneration of the forest from a clear-cut area. the dynamic vegetation parameter is available in the noah-mp model. if dynamic vegetation doesn't add any significant realism, we will go with static vegetation model to answer our questions. initially, the nasa-lis will be used to spin up different idealized deforestation scenario of alberta. the ensemble of scenarios will be coupled with wrf at 9 km resolution and wrf-hydro extension will be added to route the runoff. we have proposed a modeling experiment in addition to three questions regarding the impact on regional hydroclimate and mesoscale circulations. the specific questions are: 1) how does land use/land cover change effect the diurnal precipitation cycle and local hydroclimate of alberta's athabasca river basin? 2) how does land use/land cover change impact the regional hydrologic cycle of the alberta province? 3) how is the regional atmospheric circulation over the alberta province altered by land use/land cover change? the increasing population and growing demand for energy and land throughout the world have caused rapid and large-scale land use/cover change. the results from this study are critically important to better understand the impact of those land use/cover changes in hydrology and mesoscale atmospheric circulations and our ability to model them using nu-wrf/lis. similarly, the results will be helpful for policymakers and industries to better understand and mitigate any adverse effects caused by rapid land use/cover change.

teacher preparatory activities to one hundred forty (140) students, who are low-income, first-generation and/or individuals with disabilities.   more specifically we have the following three objectives: objective 1: retention in postsecondary education: 85% of all participants served by the sss project will persist from one academic year to the beginning of the next academic year or will have earned a bachelor's degree at the grantee institution during the academic year. objective 2: in good academic standing: 92% of all enrolled sss participants being served will meet the performance level required to stay in good academic standing at the grantee institution.  objective 3: completion of a baccalaureate degree: 65% of new participants served each year will graduate from the grantee institution with a bachelor's degree or equivalent within six (6) years.   there is a need for the project at ualbany, based on a high number and percentage of students enrolled who are low-income, first-generation and/or individuals with disabilities with academic need based on retention and graduation rates, grade point averages and graduate and professional school enrollment rates.   the objectives in the proposal are both ambitious, as related to the need data provided, and attainable, given the comprehensive plan of high quality services and activities described in the plan of operation. the institutional commitment outlines strong resources to supplement and enhance the project services, administrative and academic policies that enhance participants' retention and improve graduation rates, minimized participants' dependence on loans, and assures full cooperation and support from the admissions, student aid, registrar and institutional research offices. the proposed quality of personnel demonstrates the aim to recruit and retain highly qualified project staff that have succeeded in overcoming barriers similar to those confronting the project's target population. the proposal's budget and cost-effectiveness are adequate to support the planned project services and activities and are reasonable in relation to the objectives and scope. the proposed evaluation plan is appropriate to the project, includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluation measures, and examines in specific and measurable ways the success of the project in making progress toward achieving its process (formative evaluation) and outcome objectives (summative evaluation). finally, the quality of the project design demonstrates a rationale, utilizing a logic model to show theoretical and operational relationships among the key project components and desired outcomes.   this proposal addresses the two competitive preference priorities: (1) fostering flexible and affordable paths to obtaining knowledge and skills and (2) fostering knowledge and promoting the development of skills that prepare students to be informed, thoughtful, and productive individuals and citizens. we propose interventions that will ensure student learning objectives are aligned with the skills and knowledge required for employment and participants build personal financial understanding and responsibility.  abstract the university at albany (ualbany) educational opportunity centers (eoc) program will serve individuals in capital district, new york with a focus on the cities of albany, schenectady and troy. each participant must be (1) a citizen or permanent resident of the united states; (2) at least 19 years of age, a veteran regardless of age, or if less than 19 years of age the individual cannot be appropriately served by a talent search project and the individual's participation would not dilute the educational opportunity centers project's services to those at least 19 years of age; and (3) express a desire to enroll, or is enrolled, in a program of postsecondary education, and requests information or assistance in applying for admission to, or financial aid for, such a program. we will prepare participants for admission to and enrollment in postsecondary programs.  more specifically we have the following four objectives: secondary school diploma: 70% of participants served during the project year, who do not have a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, will receive a secondary school diploma or its equivalent during the project year. financial aid applications: 75% of participants served during the project year who are not already enrolled in a postsecondary education program and who: 1) are high school seniors; 2) are high school graduates; or 3) have obtained a high school equivalency certificate, will apply for financial aid during the project year. postsecondary education admissions: 75 % of participants served during the project year who are not already enrolled in a postsecondary education program and who: 1) are high school seniors; 2) are high school graduates; or 3) have obtained a high school equivalency certificate, will apply for college admission during the project year. postsecondary education enrollment: 65% of participants who graduate from secondary school and are not already enrolled in a postsecondary education program will enroll in a postsecondary education program immediately following participation in an eoc program or will have received notification, by the fall semester, of acceptance but deferred enrollment until the next academic semester (e.g. spring semester).  there is a need for the project based on a high number and percentage low-income families, individuals with education competition levels below the baccalaureate, and need for further education and training. the objectives in the proposal are ambitious, as related to the need data provided,

fostering flexible and affordable paths to obtaining knowledge and skills, and 3. applications that demonstrate a rationale.      abstract    the university at albany (ualbany) veterans upward bound (vub) program will serve veterans  in new york’s capital  district with  a  focus  on  albany,  rensselaer,  and  schenectady counties.  ualbany vub will provide intensive basic skills development in those academic subjects required  for   successful   completion   of   a   high   school   equivalency   program   and   for   admission   to  postsecondary education programs, short-term remedial or refresher courses, assistance in securing  support services from other locally available resources, and special services to enable the transition  to postsecondary education to 125 participants in the target area. two-thirds (2/3) of the project’s  participants will be low-income individuals who are potential first-generation college students, and  the  remaining  participants  will  be  low-income,  or  potential  first-generation  college  students,  or  veterans who have a high risk for academic failure.    more specifically we have the following four objectives:  1. academic  improvement  on  standardized  test: 76% of  participants  who  completed  their  vub educational program during the project year will improve their academic performance.  2. education  program  retention  and  completion: 86% of  participants  served  during  the  project year will complete their vub educational program by the end of the project year or remain  enrolled in the program.  3. postsecondary  enrollment: 75% of  participants  who  completed  their  prescribed  vub  educational  program  in  the  previous  project  year  will  enroll  in  a  program  of  postsecondary  education by the end of the next project year.  4. postsecondary  completion: 30% of  participants  who  completed  the  vub  educational  program in one project year and who enrolled in a program of postsecondary education by the end  of  the  next  project  year  will  complete  a  program  of  postsecondary  education  within  six  project  years.    there is a need for the program in the target area because there is a lack of services for eligible  veterans,  a  large  number  of veterans  that  are  low  income  and  potential  first-generation  college  students, and a large number of veterans who have not completed high school or completed high  school  and  have  not  enrolled  in  a  program  of  postsecondary  education. the objectives in  the  proposal  are  both

    "carolyn macdonald": "    radiation therapy (rt) to small targets (e.g., < ~4 mm), especially conformal radiation to irregular targets,  is  generally  not  practical  with  current rt devices due  to  the  divergent  characteristic  of  x-ray  beams.   collimating  the  beam  to  a  very  small  diameter  degrades  the  penumbra  and  reduces the  power  efficiency  significantly.    medical  illnesses,  however,  present  with  a  host  of  small  targets  that  would  theoretically  be  responsive to rt.  to overcome the fundamental shortcomings of the current collimation-based rt device for  small, shallow target treatment, we propose to build a novel focused kv x-ray stereotactic rt system based on  cutting-edge  polycapillary x-ray optics (1).   our  phantom  experiments  and monte  carlo  (mc)  computer  simulations verified its feasibility for ocular melanoma treatment (2).  we have extensive expertise in kv small  animal irradiators (3, 4).  one immediate clinical application can be wet-type (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration (amd).   amd is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries (5, 6).  the mainstay of treatment for wet-amd –  intravitreal  injection  of vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (vegf) inhibitors (7) – requires  repeated injection  every several weeks, costing over $30,000/year (8), and have the risk of injury, infection, etc (9).  rt has been  attempted (10) with mixed results because the benefits may  have been masked  by the accompanying retinal  radiation damage due to the coarse radiation beams used.  the latest intrepid trial (11) used collimated kv  x-ray beams to treat a universal 4 mm area in the center of macula for all patients.  the treatment reduced the  need for chronic anti-vegf injections.  because the treatment is substantially more efficient for lesion size <4  mm  vs  the  larger ones and radiation  related  retinal  damage increases in  follow-up  up  to  3  years (12), it  is  reasoned smaller lesions were overtreated, while larger lesions were undertreated.  our proposed, conformal  focused x-ray treatment may significantly improve the dosimetry that may be translated into superior outcome.   it allows  scanning  to  personalize  the  treatment  with  optimized  dose  painting  and  the  delivery  of  highly- concentrated x-rays  to  the  lesion  with  pinpoint  accuracy,  thus  reduces  unwanted  radiation  to  nearby  healthy  tissues.  with  small  focus  perpendicular  to  the  beam  (<0.2 mm),  it  also  enables  the  possibility  of  the  novel  concept  of  grid  therapy (13).  spatial  fractionation  (grid)  with  dose  peaks  and  valleys  has  been  shown  to  preferentially damage abnormal neovascular blood vessels vs normal blood vessels (14).  the potential of rt for many non-cancerous diseases has been underutilized partially because of the lack  of preclinical studies limited by the inability of current small animal irradiators to precisely target a small volume.   conformal  treatment to small  volumes in, e.g., rodents would require highly focused beam  delivery,  not  possible  with  current devices.   the focused  x-ray  technique  has  unique advantages  of  delivering  stereotactic  radiosurgery   to   small   animals.  immediate   applications include preclinical studies of   radiation-based  neuromodulation and  targeted  vessel  radiation.    recent  clinical observations  suggest that  precisely  targeted  irradiation  can  alter  local  neuronal  function  without  inducing  a necrotic/apoptotic  lesion (15).  tuning  of  complex brain circuit dynamics – much as is done with implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes – could be  emulated   non-invasively using radiation (15).  classical   radiobiology   teaches   us   very   little   about  radiomodulation.  rt to  small  animals  as  a  counterpart of  human  treatment  is  of  paramount  importance  to  perform  comprehensive,  controlled  preclinical  studies  on  a  large  number  of  objects  at  a  low  cost,  and is a  crucial and informative tool for target identification and treatment strategy development (16, 17).  our proposed  technique  will  fill  this critical  void and guide  clinical trial  designs.  because  of  the larger target  size  in  human  brain, modern medical linacs with stereotactic radiosurgery capability can be used for clinical neuromodulation.   the  work  can ultimately  lead  to novel treatment  of  human  diseases,  such  as addiction, a  neuropsychiatric  disorder that has extraordinary global economic impact.  the  goal  of  this  proposal  is  to  build  and commission a  prototype  focused kv  x-ray  system  to  enable  subsequent pre-clinical translational laboratory and clinical research.  our specific aims are:  specific aim 1. design and build a prototype pre-clinical focused kv x-ray system  simulation  of  the  optics is achieved  via  mc-based  3d  geometric  ray  tracing.    we  will create a  single  simulation code which incorporates and fine-tunes all of the necessary features to accurately model the output  beam to enable rapid assessment of the effects of changes in the source and optic designs; determine designs  with optimal output focal spot shape, dose rate, and energy spectrum for treatment of lesions of variable size.  aim 2. dosimetric commissioning to establish a fully characterized functional prototype system   to perform systematic source, optic, and dosimetry measurements to characterize the spatial and spectral  beam features and dosimetric output of the prototype system; and to perform in depth uncertainty analysis.  aim 3. develop a mc-based treatment planning system for focused x-ray treatment   to carry  out  dose  calculation  for  simple geometries using “scanning while rotating” beam delivery and  verify  the  calculation  accuracy  through film  measurements;  to evaluate various  delivery  methods  to  learn the  dose distribution behaviors; to test the treatment plan design using custom phantoms; and to verify mc dose   calculations  with  dosimeter  measurements.   after  successful phantom verification, to test  planning  strategies  using  patient/animal imaging  data and to compare  the  dosimetric  characteristics with collimated  divergent  beams.  references    1. macdonald    ca.

intrinsically divergent x-ray radiation that needs to be collimated to treat a  diseased region.  the penumbra and power efficiency limit the minimal size of a radiation field to one centimeter  for  mv  beams  and  a  few  millimeters  for  kv  beams.   therefore,  a host  of  medical conditions that may be  responsive to local radiation cannot be effectively treated because of their small size and intolerable collateral  damages  to  surrounding  critical  organs.  to  overcome  the  fundamental  issues  of  collimated  radiation,  this  proposal  aims  to  develop a  focused  kv  x-ray  system  based  on  novel  usage  of polycapillary  x-ray lens.  the  proposed technique can focus x-ray beams to less than 0.2 mm in diameter.  the beam can scan to conformally  delivery radiation dose to small, shallow targets while minimizing the radiation damage to surrounding healthy  tissues.  our goal is to build and fully characterize a functional prototype focused kv x-ray platform for phantom  and preclinical treatment planning research.  strong evidence has shown that radiation may be a viable treatment  approach  for neovascular  age-related  macular  degeneration  (amd),  which  affects  tens  of  millions  of  patients  worldwide.    it  attacks  a  different  amd  pathway  than  the mainstay vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (vegf)  inhibitor  for  amd  treatment.  anti-vegf therapy requires  repeated  injection  every  few  weeks  with  a  risk  of  surgical injury and costs over $30,000/year.  radiation treatment using one universal 4 mm diameter kv radiation  for all patients is being trialed to synergistically combine with anti-vegf drugs.  the current results are promising  in terms of reducing the number of required anti-vegf injections, but indicate insufficient dosimetric coverage  for lesions larger than 4 mm and occasional radiation toxicity.  we hypothesize that using the proposed focused  x-ray  technique  to personalize conformal  radiation according  to lesion morphology can  improve  outcomes  by  enhancing the  target  coverage  and  minimizing  the  toxicity  to  healthy  retina  at  the  same  time.  besides,  this  technique offers a novel dose delivery strategy of highly spatially-modulated grid therapy, which has been shown  to preferentially damage abnormal neovasculature vs normal blood vessels.  the proposed technique can also  treat ultrasmall targets in rodents (comparable to the relative size in humans) for preclinical research that cannot  be performed using  collimated  divergent  beams  without  inevitably  irradiating  a  relatively  large  volume  of  uninvolved  tissues.   specific  aims: design  and  build  a  prototype  pre-clinical  system,  perform  dosimetric  commissioning of the system and develop a monte carlo (mc)-based treatment planning system for focused x- ray treatment. study design: a unified mc code will be written to simulate the x-ray transport in polycapillary  lens and in patient for dose calculation. extensive phantom dosimetry measurements will be performed to tune  the mc model.  treatment planning optimization and factors affecting the targeting and dosimetric uncertainties  will be studied.  health relatedness: this proposal aims to address the unmet need of conformal radiotherapy  delivery to small, mm-sized targets based on the lesion shape and critical structure sparing.

(2) develop and validate an integrated swat-hydrus-modflow (shm) model to assess the influences of irrigation practices emphasizing water quality challenges. (3) assess the responses of food and environmental sustainability indicators to the driving factors of irrigation using recycled wastewater (various irrigation practices) at the field and watershed scales over short and long timescales under current and future climate conditions in the sjrb. intellectual merit provide transformative findings for areas with similar conditions as the sjrb and transformative approaches for agroecosystems: (1) an integrated shm model that can advance the understandings of how irrigation using recycled wastewater with various irrigation practices affects the food and environmental sustainability indicators; as well as understand and address other food, soil, and water quantity/quality issues in agroecosystems. (2) understandings of the responses of food and environmental sustainability indicators to the driving factors of irrigation using recycled wastewater (various irrigation practices) in the sjrb at the field and watershed scales over short and long timescales under current and future climate conditions.

(2) create new approaches and parameterize the design level model to study the life cycle impacts of individual bioretention cells using existing data. (3) evaluate how the impacts of individual bioretention cells respond to various internal (design features, initial conditions, and life cycle features of bioretention cells) and external (drainage area features, weather conditions, and atmospheric deposition characteristics) driving factors for both short-term and life cycle using the parameterized design level model. (4) explore future adaptation pathways to optimally design and manage bioretention cells under various conditions that maximize benefits and minimize costs. the educational goal of this project is to increase the knowledge of highly diverse groups (k-12 students and teachers, undergraduate students, graduate students, and diverse social groups) about urban hydrologic and water quality processes, gi practices, and sustainable urban stormwater management. other specific educational objectives are developing a new undergraduate and graduate cross-listed course, and training the next generation of environmental engineers in sustainable urban stormwater management. the project will employ educational approaches such as workshops, lectures, demonstrations, hands-on design and planning experiences, symposiums, field trips, and research activities to multiple target groups.  intellectual merit provide: (1) new design level tools with learning materials and supporting data for researchers to understand how bioretention cells function and study future adaptation pathways to optimally design and manage bioretention cells. (2) a comprehensive understanding of the short-term and life cycle impacts of individual bioretention cells on surface and subsurface hydrology and nutrients under various internal and external conditions, significantly advancing current knowledge of how bioretention cells function. (3) optimized strategies to cost-effectively design and manage bioretention cells that can greatly advance sustainable urban stormwater management. (4) approaches and findings of studying bioretention cells that are transformative for studying other types of gi practices and pollutants. (5) opportunities for coupling the design level model with watershed level planning models for system-level stormwater management in future studies that can fill the gap between site level design and watershed level planning. broader impacts in advancing our knowledge of how bioretention cells function for their optimal design and management, this project provides a framework for studying other types of gi practices and pollutants, and promotes the integration of design and planning level models for system-level stormwater management. the project will also increase the participation of k-12 students from underrepresented groups in the stem fields, and motivate them to pursue stem careers; enhance high school teaching with additional knowledge and educational resources for high school teachers; develop a new undergraduate and graduate cross-listed course on sustainable urban stormwater management that will incorporate cutting-edge research findings and better prepare students for rewarding careers; mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students through research activities that better prepare them for professional careers; and increase the knowledge and participation of diverse social groups in sustainable urban stormwater management.

sensing applications try to retrieve soil moisture (or anything) from specific licensed spectrum. often those bands are contaminated due to rf emitters (harmonics, etc.) and cannot be used to retrieve meaningful remote sensing data. our goal is to make the radiometers wideband so that it can retrieve remote sensing data from licensed or unlicensed spectrum. 2) there exists some high resolution radiometer research, but they also treat interference blindly by just looking at the statistical properties of the signal/interference. so, we propose to utilize a) the knowledge of harmonics to cancel it out and b) feedback from the communication network to estimate the noise, which can be cancelled out leading to better estimates. 3) passive radiometers are most difficult to handle as they are passive and cannot be detected by commu- nication network. that’s why they only operate in licensed band to guarantee interference free reception. however, neither interference free channel can exist (show example), but also is difficult to ascertain the source or reason of this interference. hence, an active signalling between the communication network and radiometers is necessary to collaborate on common goals: 1) find multiple clean (interference free) bands for radiometer for remote sensing applications and 2) maximize the utilization of rest of the bands for com- munication. highly integrated and distributed recognition architecture for anti-ballistic missile (hydra-abm) system  abstract  to provide the u.s. missile defense agency with an artificial intelligence/machine learning (ai/ml) system that distributes across multiple sensors and systems terminating at the interceptor, american gnc corporation (agnc) and the university at albany - state university of new york (ualbany) are proposing the highly integrated and distributed recognition architecture for anti-ballistic missile (hydra-abm) system. the hydra-abm system is designed considering (i) mda's ballistic missile defense systems requirements, (ii) variety of networked sensors, and (iii) networked communications. the system design starts with a thorough review of sensors used by anti-ballistic missile systems to identify available data, integration schemes, preprocessing needs, and requirements of specific sensor systems. this is complemented with a distributed processing scheme to provide federated learning for conducting accurate object classification. the hydra-abm system implementation will be optimized by conducting a thorough analysis of (1) the computational load at nodes, (2) impact of message content and size on the system performance, and (3) accuracy of the threat detection and identification. benchmarking will be a core activity and will be conducted at the component, subsystem, and system level, where interrelations and effects will be thoroughly analyzed.  key innovations include: (a) design for a variety of networked sensors used in ballistic missile defense system and (b) highly optimized and secure federated learning scheme.       abstract  the growing need for spectrum to support the next generation (xg) wireless networks can only be satisfied by coexistence of frequency-agile, cognitive and heterogeneous nodes. as new spectrum (sub-6ghz, 6ghz, mmwave & terahertz) becomes available, spectrum access will be congested, contested and competitive.  classical cryptography has always been an add-on feature for communication as a result of the layered approach to network design.  physical layer security has gained attention as a technology to secure wireless communication, but is chosen to complement cryptography, not as a replacement. cryptography guarantees security regardless of the signal reception capability of adversary but under the assumption of constrained computational power of the adversary. practical quantum computing at scale would significantly impact several cryptographic algorithms currently in wide use.   on the other hand, physical layer security finds its roots in information theory and holds without any restriction of the adversary's computation capability, but with the constraint on adversary's signal reception quality. it is provable and quantifiable, but does not guarantee security in various realistic environment. so, even with these great benefits of physical layer security, it is not adopted for deployment.  both these technologies impose different constraints on the adversary, which is unrealistic in many practical scenarios.  hence, it is crucial to investigate in novel algorithms that ensures security in wireless communication in most adverse conditions where each or both of these techniques fail. hence, the goal of this project is to create a new domain with long-term educational and research plans that enables highly secure practical communication without any constraints on adversary's reception or computational capabilities for the next generation wireless systems.   swift: scisrs: signal cancellation intelligent surfaces for radio astronomy services  abstract  the proposal presents a new paradigm of mitigating growing radio frequency interference (rfi) at the radio telescope by accurately detecting, locating the rfi and cancelling it using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ris). the main objective of this project is to innovate methods to a) accurately estimate the rfi incident at the telescope and b) configure the phases of the reflecting surfaces to precisely reject the incident rfi both in phase and amplitude. continuous feedback from the telescope also improves the performance of the interference cancellation model. our solution is waveform, frequency and protocol independent, which makes the core technology applicable for various sources of rfi. if successful, it will enhance the fidelity of astronomical measurements in radio telescopes, while increasing spatial spectrum reuse of wireless networks. these enhancements will transcend the telescopes from passive devices to cognitive and intelligent instruments, greatly increasing its contribution to future astronomical explorations. a testbed will be developed using xilinx rfsoc with 16-antenna elements and real time signal processing in fpga, a large ris unit and a small radio telescope. the system will be validated using over-the-air experiments for cancelling aeronautical signals at dsa-110 array at the owens valley radio observatory (ovro).   statement of work sttr af22b-t005,  complex emitter behavioral analysis using machine learning  for university at

date: 08/01/2022 is there funded and/or non-funded external domestic collaboration? yes title: investigation of ofdm for multipath channels in deep space exploration jpl investigators (section(s)): marc sanchez-net (332h, pi), dariush divsalar (332b, co-i), kar-ming cheung (332h, co-i). external domestic co-investigators (affiliation(s)) (if any):  prof. dola saha, university at albany (co-i) background: during the next decades, nasa plans to land rovers and/or landers in regions around the lunar south pole where earth will be viewed at low elevation angles [1]. this geometry will cause multipath effects in the direct-to-earth (dte) link, a phenomenon that has been experienced in real-life operations both at mars (after mer landing, and on proximity links) and on the moon, and is known to increase link error rates if not properly mitigated [2,3]. one of the options to mitigate fading is to use mobile communication standards such as the ones published by 3gpp. in fact, nasa is currently preforming a 3gpp engagement effort to better understand how 3gpp standards and technologies can be used to foster commercialization of space communication systems in near-earth and the moon. in this proposal, we study how to mitigate fading for high rate links (≥1mbps) between the lunar south pole and earth using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ofdm), a multicarrier signaling scheme standardized in 3gpp-lte for high rate links from a base station to a mobile terminal [4]. in a multipath environment, ofdm offers several advantages compared to traditional single-carrier methods standardized in ccsds, most notably the reduction of inter-symbol interference (isi), which is typically the dominant error source in high-rate links. it also has advantages compared alternative ways of mitigating fading such as equalization or antenna diversity. for example, equalizers require an infinite number of taps to properly match the channel (which is impractical for implementation in space radios) and tend to amplify noise. similarly, antenna diversity requires the spacecraft to have multiple antennas to transmit and receive. finally, while ofdm requires fft operations that were once impractical to implement in spacecraft radios, new software-defined radios such as iris have already demonstrated the ability to perform real-time ffts for other signal processing functionality such as carrier acquisition [5]. objectives: we will study the performance of ofdm in high-rate x-band dte links between earth and the lunar south pole using viper as a case study [6]. in particular, we will (1) integrate ofdm with the lower layers of the ccsd protocol stack; (2) derive optimal ofdm configuration parameters for the dte; (3) quantify the frame error rate (fer) of ofdm and compare it against traditional ccsds signaling schemes; (4) quantify the performance loss incurred by using a non-constant envelope waveform and compare it against the gain due to using a multicarrier modulation; (5) quantify changes in viper's telecom link budgets if ofdm had been available to support the mission. approach: using a numerical multipath model previously developed by the pi [7], together with basic viper mission parameters (e.g., landing traverse, etc.) already available to the team, we will first estimate the characteristics of the dte multipath channel (strength of reflections, delay and doppler spread). based on these, we will derive the fft size, guard bands, number of pilots and pilot positions in an ofdm symbol. then, we will develop an end-to-end simulation system that includes transmitter and receiver blocks of the ofdm waveform together with a ccsds-compliant modulation for each of the ofdm sub-carriers. using this setup, we will quantify the performance of the system in two-steps, first by assuming perfect tracking and synchronization (upper bound system performance), and then including losses from removing this assumption (optional, depending on time availability). this system will also allow us to quantify the peak-to-average power ratio (papr) and optimize the ofdm parameters to minimize its effect. finally, results of this proposal are expected to be extensible to other scenarios besides viper, including other landers of nasa's clps program, the human landing system or rover at mars, and inform the on-going 3gpp engagement effort. deliverable: at least one journal publication (interplanetary progress report, or similar) external domestic collaborator work/deliverables (if any):  simulink models of the ofdm

industry-academia partnership advancing research and cutting-edge technologies to improve the energy industry's power grid efficiency and reliability in the face of intensification of weather extremes in a changing climate and transition to clean energy. the center will support research in (i) renewable energy generation and power grid integration, (ii) weather-caused outage forecasting, management and restoration, and (iii) electric grid resilience assessment and economic analysis of resilience improvements. through graduate-certificate programs, the center will enhance workforce development in the areas of weather innovation, grid modernization and smart energy. in the planning grant phase, we have targeted 50 industry partners ranging from start-up to large scale enterprises, both private and public with regional to global coverage, to join us in planning and developing the center. in addition, we plan to engage national research centers as collaborators to leverage their research expertise with our university teams to extend the breadth and depth of our research projects. intellectual merit: the wiser iucrc will investigate the impact of weather and climate hazards on the energy industry. wiser research will produce novel predictive modeling tools (leveraging numerical weather prediction (nwp) and artificial intelligence (ai)-based impact modeling) for managing renewable energy and storm outages from a range of weather events and will demonstrate the integration of total system resilience modeling with dynamic economic and policy analysis and forecasting tools based on electric utility infrastructure systems. the project will also produce novel, experimentally-derived knowledge about the effects of roadside forest management approaches and disturbance agents on tree biomechanics and stability. this basic knowledge is fundamental to understanding ideal management approaches for utility-adjacent vegetation and optimal allocation and promotion of those approaches. experimental findings will be combined with geospatial data on infrastructure and vegetation risk/health, and spatially explicit socioeconomic and ethnographic data addressing potential opportunities and barriers to uptake of management strategies. these combinations of data can then be incorporated as a new and dynamic input into models predicting damage outcomes and optimizing storm response and resource allocation strategies. in terms of renewables, the proposed projects will provide new insights as to the economic and technological constraints to maintaining the desirable power grid reliability and resilience to extreme weather and security events. broader impacts: the research directions of wiser are mandated by actual and urging national energy industry problems. disruption to everyday lives, safety issues, economic and infrastructure losses are some of the multi-faceted impacts due to extensive power outages. as power outages get predicted more accurately and restoration times are minimized, the outcomes from this project will directly benefit society. the predictive models to be developed will be expanded to support utility preparedness and restoration decision support systems for power outages associated with a variety of causes, ranging from severe storms to wildfire ignition conditions in the west and heatwaves in the midwest. furthermore, the research and practical implementation information developed in wiser are broadly relevant to utility programs across all geographies and could help to promote grid resilience nationally in the face of increasing storm frequency and severity. the proposed research would help improve broad scale management of forests to reduce risk to infrastructure as well as reduce forest damage and resulting losses of ecological and economic productivity. furthermore, research in the wiser will improve understanding of the environmental and forest characteristics that are predictive of tree failure and which can be quantified through remote sensing and geospatial analysis.  the wiser weather and climate remote sensing and predictive models will also be used to derive supply and demand analytics for the renewable energy industry (solar, hydro, etc.)  wiser will recruit graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to increase minority participation in stem, particularly by providing experiential learning, interdisciplinary collaborations, and exposure to industry-academia partnerships.  project summary  state and local decision-makers within regional emergency management systems have relied upon inadequate geophysical modeling information and have struggled to address governance issues necessary to take optimal localized protective action-issuing flood warnings, directing sandbagging, deploying first responders, and ordering shelter-in-place or evacuation-which inadvertently put communities in peril.   given the acceleration and growing intensity of climate change and weather extremes, our proposed srs rn: building resiliency through information-empowered decision-making and community engagement for regional sustainability (bridges) to address the disconnect in emergency management systems between regional decision-making needs and the existing flood forecasting models and information necessary to protect life and property. this disconnect between the geophysical models and the action on the ground is a critical gap in knowledge, a chasm in communication, and a grand challenge facing the scientific community which continues to threaten society today.  the grand challenge of flood resilience in governance and emergency management systems from new york city along the hudson river corridor will be addressed through cross disciplinary collaborations with regional decision-makers, geoscientists, social scientists, and computational scientists. the current linear framework in urban and rural systems today is focused on the geophysical modeler, and moreover neglects to embed the local decision makers' needs into the models during an event. these models are generally inflexible with predefined, prescheduled, and static characteristics, often leading to ineffective regional protective action during a flooding event. this srs rn will shift this paradigm by incorporating decision makers' needs into an adaptive geophysical modeling framework. by embedding regional and local decision-makers in geophysical model development, our framework will ensure that the flood hazard information generated will be more relevant and that subsequent protective action decisions are more precise and impactful to mitigate effects of flooding at the local level in both rural and urban settings ​   designated an nystar center of excellence (coe) in 2015, ualbany's center of excellence in weather & climate analytics is the state's entrepreneurial hub for a network of over 120 weather and climate faculty, researchers and research staff based at ualbany. together, these experts are deeply engaged in advancing innovative weather and climate research applications with

areas of decision-making, communication and crisis management as it relates to weather and climate extremes and resilient communities.  with this broad expertise, ua will be able to contribute and collaborate on potential projects in all 5 ncas-m research pathways. in particular, ua would have strong interests in exploitation of nys mesonet observations for improving our knowledge of the pbl, developing products for improving situational awareness, and improving nwp short-range skill through data assimilation (rp1, rp2, rp3).  ua can make strong research contributions to air quality forecasting (rp2). ua also has a strong research interest in in the areas of decision-making, and communication of weather risks (rp4 and rp5).   a critical gap in atmospheric observations lies within the lowest few kilometers of the atmosphere.  referred to as the \"boundary layer\", the area between 20 m and 3 km above ground level (agl) is not routinely measured in space or time, and this gap in measurement inhibits accurate, reliable forecasts at the surface. to address this gap, the new york state mesonet is now testing a network of ground-based remote sensing instruments to routinely measure the temperature, moisture, and wind profiles within the boundary layer. a focused, multi-year program, known as the empire state vertical sensing evaluation regional testbed experiment (vertex), will evaluate and improve the quality and robustness of ground-based vertical profiling technology, integrate data from ground-based vertical profiling sensors into national weather service (nws) real-time operations, and assess the value of continuous boundary layer-sensing technologies for improving operations and the cost-effectiveness of integrating these technologies into the national weather enterprise observing infrastructure. vertex will act as a national platform for testing and incorporating these technologies into operations ",
    "bijan dey": "  project summary/abstract    duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a fatal x-linked childhood muscle degenerative disease. children with  dmd become restricted to wheelchairs within the first decade of their lives and die within the third, and there is  no effective treatment available for the disease. key myogenic processes and dmd pathophysiology at the  cellular and molecular level are not completely understood, hindering the development of therapies for dmd. to  fill this knowledge gap, we have been investigating whether an emerging mode of post-transcriptional gene  regulation known as epitranscriptomics plays a role in normal muscle development (myogenesis) and in dmd  pathogenesis. epitranscriptomics is a dynamic process that regulates rna stability, splicing and translation by  reversible chemical modifications on rnas. n6-methyladenosine (m 6 a) is the most abundant epitranscriptomic  mark on eukaryotic rnas. m 6 a is installed by a multiprotein writer complex that includes methyltransferase like  3 (mettl3) and methyltransferase like 14 (mettl14), and erased by alkylation repair homolog 5 (alkbh5)  and fat  mass- and  obesity-associated  (fto),  although fto may preferentially  demethylate n6,2′-o- dimethyladenosine (m 6 am). the  yth domain-containing reader proteins (ythdf1-3, ythdc1-2) and igf2  mrna-binding proteins 1, 2, and 3 (igf2bp1-3) selectively recognize m 6 a on rnas and control the fate of m 6 a- modified rnas. intrigued by the possibility that m 6 a mrna methylation may regulate myogenesis and dmd, we  have recently found that mettl3, mettl14 and m 6 a levels are downregulated, and that alkbh5 is upregulated  during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration. at the transcriptome-wide level, we observed increased  m 6 a marks near the stop codons of mrnas belonging to important myogenic pathways. moreover, knockdown  of m 6 a writer in a mouse model of dmd muscle restored some of these target mrnas. these preliminary studies  suggest  that m 6 a mrna  methylation  plays  a  central  role  in normal  myogenic  processes and in dmd  pathophysiology. here, we propose to test this hypothesis. we will employ cutting-edge molecular cell biology  and genetic approaches to determine the role of m 6 a mrna methylation in skeletal myogenesis using cell-based  and mouse models. to gain deeper mechanistic insight into and to identify the molecular players involved in this  process, we will perform a transcriptome-wide analysis to map m 6 a sites and identify direct target mrnas in the  regenerating muscle stem cells (muscs) and muscle fibers, and also in muscs and muscle fibers of dmd mouse  model (mdx mice). finally, we will determine whether restoring the m 6 a mrna methylation level can improve  skeletal muscle function in mdx mice. our proposed research will make a significant impact by elucidating a  fundamental  molecular  mechanism  of  m 6 a mrna  methylation  in  key  myogenic  processes  and  dmd  pathophysiology. our ultimate goal is to validate m 6 a mrna methylation as a potential therapeutic axis for dmd.    project summary/abstract  the  coronavirus  disease  2019  (covid-19)  pandemic  is  caused  by  a  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). sars-cov-2 is highly pathogenic and, in less than two years since the report of  the first case, has infected over 252 million people and caused more than 5 million deaths worldwide. the virus  continues to be a threat, highlighting the need for intensified research efforts to understand sars-cov-2’s  biology and various aspects of host-pathogen interactions. sars-cov-2 primarily infects lung cells, resulting in  a  range  of  respiratory  symptoms.  sars-cov-2  also  damages  many  other  vital  organs,  including  skeletal  muscles.  since  skeletal  muscles  play  a  critical  role  in  maintaining  the  whole-body  physiological  function,  including respiration, skeletal muscle injury by sars-cov-2 further increases the complexity of covid-19.  additional  covid-19  complications  involving  skeletal  muscle  injuries,  such  as  muscle  inflammation,  pain,  neuromuscular problems, and rhabdomyolysis, have also been reported, severely affecting patients’ recovery  and quality of life. despite the extent of covid-19’s effect on skeletal muscles, not much is known about the  mechanisms that govern these effects. given that human skeletal muscles express both angiotensin-converting  enzyme 2 (ace2), a critical host cell receptor for sars-cov-2 entry and the crucial component of the skeletal  muscle renin-angiotensin system (ras), and cellular proteases trmprss2 and cathepsins, required for sars- cov-2 processing and host cell fusion, it has been hypothesized that the virus may exert effects on skeletal  muscles by direct infection (direct effects). on the other hand, sars-cov-2 infection has been shown to trigger  the release of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and other related factors known to affect skeletal muscles  indirectly (indirect effects). at this point, it remains unknown whether sars-cov-2 infection effects on skeletal  muscles are due to primarily direct or indirect effects or a combination of both. here, we propose to provide  critical insights into these questions by examining both direct and indirect effects of sars-cov-2 on the skeletal  muscles and myogenesis, an essential process for skeletal muscle repair and regeneration upon injury, such as  the one due to viral infection. we propose to (1) determine whether sars-cov-2 enters skeletal muscle cells;  (2) reveal both direct and indirect impacts of sars-cov-2 infection on skeletal muscles and myogenesis; and  (3) determine the anti-inflammatory and protective role of an ace inhibitor (acei) used for the treatment of high  blood pressure  by  regulating  the  ras,  as  possible  therapeutic  strategies  for  mitigating  skeletal  muscle  complications  after  sars-cov-2  infection.  taken  together,  our  findings  will  address  a  range  of  previously  unexplored questions related to the interplay among sars-cov-2 infection, muscle injury, and myogenesis with  important implications for basic mechanisms that govern sars-cov-2 biology as well as a clinical intervention.

    "jeannette sutton": " abstract  problem. the design of earthquake early warning (eew) messages is a priority research area for the usgs and shakealert community. although eew provides a tremendous opportunity to reduce human, property, and economic losses, critical research gaps remain. despite decades of research about warnings and human response following the onset of earthquake shaking, little research has been conducted on the unique context of eew. understanding the best ways to craft eew messages to motivate people to take action is essential to realizing the potential benefits afforded by shakealert and other eew systems. shakealert technology is currently limited to sending a single, identical message to all recipients, regardless of users' location or situation despite research demonstrating that personalized, detailed messages are more effective at motivating protective action than protective actions appropriate for more general warnings (frisby, veil, & sellnow, 2014; lindell & perry, 2012; sellnow, sellnow, lane, & littlefield, 2012; sutton, vos, wood, & turner, 2018; wood et al., 2017). the purpose of this study is to examine the benefit of including additional specificity in eew messages by including information about the earthquake epicenter, countdown to shaking arrival, and anticipated shaking intensity.  summary of approach. this one year, collaborative project is a multi-method study incorporating quantitative and qualitative methods between dr. michele wood (csuf) and dr. jeannette sutton (suny-albany) and usgs. quantitative methods will consist of seven survey experiments to assess the impact of varying degrees of specificity in earthquake early warning and shakealert messages. outcomes will be measured in terms of message understanding, belief, personalization, deciding, and milling. specifically, we will examine the effect of including greater specificity in terms of communicating the hazard location (earthquake epicenter), time to impact (countdown), and hazard consequences (earthquake intensity). two experiments will examine the effect of communicating increased specificity of hazard location or earthquake epicenter-one via text and one via images. two experiments will examine the effect of communicating increased specificity of time to impact or a countdown-one comparing different types of countdowns, and one comparing different lengths of countdowns. three experiments will examine the effect of communicating increased specificity of hazard consequences or earthquake intensity-one examining the effect of including mmi, and one examining the effect of different levels of mmi, and one examining the effect of \"bi-level\" messaging (be alert/take action). qualitative methods will consist of six focus groups exploring the effect of \"bi-level\" messaging, as well as validating experimental findings. outcomes will be measured in terms of message understanding, belief, personalization, deciding, and milling.   project objectives. the objectives of this project are to: 1) examine the effects of including increased hazard specificity (location, time, and impact) on eew message outcomes, and 2) examine the effects of communicating self-protective action guidance using a bi-level approach (be alert/take action) in eew messages.  anticipated results. study results will identify the benefit of including additional specificity in eew messages by incorporating information about the earthquake epicenter, time to onset of shaking, and intensity, as well as the most effective means of providing such information.  implications.  the findings from this research will provide immediate guidance to inform eew messages, including shakealert, as well as evidence to inform the design and implementation of future associated technologies.    collaborative research: sai-p: weather severity indices for transportation infrastructure  resilience  project summary  overview  the overall objective of the proposed planning track initiative is to understand how weather severity  index metrics can be effectively developed and communicated to convey transportation infrastructure  resilience. this will be achieved by convening an interdisciplinary cohort of social and physical scientists,  stakeholders, practitioners, and end-users across the social science, weather, climate, and transportation  enterprises. this planning grant cohort will develop a foundational and transformative research roadmap  that prioritizes opportunities to quantify weather and climate impacts and identify effective methods to  communicate these impacts to the roadway transportation infrastructure. climate change and increased  societal exposure and vulnerability is enhancing the duration and magnitude of extreme weather events  and their impacts on the surface transportation network, operation, and infrastructure. moreover, these  hazardous conditions have cascading impacts to society including supply chain disruption, economic  losses associated with business closures and employee inability to travel, and loss of life on roadways  during adverse weather.  given the scope of this issue, it is prudent to better quantify and communicate  the severity of weather conditions in the context of their impacts to surface transportation infrastructure  resilience. furthermore, while significant effort has been dedicated to developing and verifying index  measurement, limited attention has been given to how they can be effectively communicated to end users.   intellectual merit  the proposed work integrates social and physical science research to support surface transportation  operations and resilience among a group of critical stakeholders. the project team brings together  transportation science and engineers, atmospheric science, and social science expertise to achieve the  goals. the goals of the proposed work are to: (1) identify and characterize the fundamental challenges  associated with the development, limitations, and communication of weather severity indices, (2) develop  requirements for weather severity index development with an emphasis on effective communication  across stakeholder groups ranging from the public to transportation officials, (3) define the most critical  research needs for future development and refinement of weather severity indices, and (4) create  meaningful, equitable, engagement opportunities for collaborative growth and implementation of weather  severity indices. accomplishing these goals will result in a research roadmap for future pursuit of  research track funding, and practice ready research activities.  broader impacts  the proposed work represents a convergent science opportunity afforded by bringing together researchers  and stakeholders across the social, physical, and transportation sciences and engineering. moreover, the  composition of the research team includes women, persons of color, and early career scholars, all of  whom are intimately aware of the need to ensure diverse, equitable perspectives and broaden  participation. the proposed work builds off the aurora pooled fund, a consortium of transportation  agencies that coordinate research activities to mitigate the impacts of hazardous weather conditions on  roadways. collaborators include social scientists, meteorologists, and transportation professionals from  federal agencies such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, and federal highway  administration, state transportation departments, universities and research organizations, and the private  sector. dissemination activities include stakeholder meetings and workshops, outreach to identify and  recruit new partners with an emphasis on ensuring diverse and equitable perspectives, conference  presentations, peer-reviewed manuscripts, and a roadmap for future research priorities. outcomes of the  work will provide a guiding framework for practical implementation of weather severity indices, promote  surface transportation resilience, and provide a foundation for future pursuit of research track funding.  page 5 of 100 submitted/pi: laura fay /proposal no: 2228348 2228348 b. project abstract summary problem. \"over-alerting\" may be conceptualized as alerting perceived to be excessive in the context of a given situation. types of over-alerting may include sending too many messages, sending too many different types of messages, sending messages to too many people, including those outside the area at risk, and sending messages for too many events, including events that do not meet a minimum threshold of danger and events that never materialize. a potential negative outcome resulting from over-alerting is that people may choose to disengage from or \"opt out\" of alerting systems. when people choose to discontinue using wireless emergency alerts (wea) and other alerting systems by opting out or deleting them, there can be a devastating impact on ability of mobile warning systems to alert members of the public about earthquakes and other imminent threats. unfortunately, little is known about how alerting authorities, who are empowered to issue formal wireless emergency alerts, and members of the public define, understand, and respond to the notion of \"over-alerting.\" thus, understanding how implementation of our alerting systems may be considered \"over-alerting\" by alerting authorities and members of the public, and how this may relate to \"opting out\", is essential. activities to be performed. this multi-faceted, mixed-method research will examine earthquake early warning messaging via alerting apps/wea and the integrated public alert and warning system portal. methods will include semi-structured individual interviews with alerting authorities (n=20), a survey of alerting authorities (n=159), and a survey of residents of 5 states-three shakealert states along with neighboring alaska and hawaii (n=2,200). the work will be carried out collaboratively by pi michele wood (california state university, fullerton) and pi jeannette sutton (university at albany), who have a track record of collaborative earthquake early warning research, including usgs funded research. interviews and surveys with alerting authorities will explore how they define, avoid, experience, and respond to \"over-alerting.\" the survey of members of the public will use the protective action decision model as a guiding framework and will incorporate concepts from the warning response model. over-alerting experience and concerns, perceived \"voluntariness\", and trust in earthquake early warning also will be included. the main outcome variables in this project will be current use of earthquake early warning apps/wea, future intention to use earthquake early warning apps/wea, and trust in earthquake early warning apps/wea.  purpose. the purpose of this study is to examine how members of the public and official alerting authorities define and understand \"over-alerting\" as well as the effects of over-alerting in the earthquake early warning and larger integrated public alert and warning system context. the unique contribution of this work is that it explores \"over-alerting\" broadly using multiple definitions and multiple methods to increase validity. deliverables and expected outcomes. deliverables include a final technical report (due 03/31/2024) and two peer-reviewed manuscripts. the first manuscript will identify correlates of public disengagement from earthquake early warning and other imminent threat warning systems. the second manuscript will examine over-alerting, message fatigue, and how members of the public and alerting authorities define, understand, avoid, and respond to over-alerting. intended beneficiaries. findings will have direct implications for federal agencies (e.g., alert and warning content, tools); alerting authorities, emergency managers, and public safety officials; and business owners (those who build mobile apps to communicate risk). this project will examine factors associated with public perceptions of \"over-alerting\" and consequent disengagement in wireless emergency alerts, shakealert, and other alerting platforms, culminating in policy recommendations to the integrated public alert and warning system and the federal communications commission on the use of wireless emergency alerts for catastrophic events. importantly, as the integrated public alert and warning system is increasingly used for imminent threat events such as earthquakes, evidence informing the design and implementation of such messages will be increasingly important. given the variety of channels and standards delivering earthquake early warning message content, in the absence of evidence-based guidance about over-alerting, over-alerting may inadvertently lead to public disengagement and inhibit the realization of potential system benefits (i.e., reduced earthquake-related deaths and injuries). message receivers will benefit because decision makers will have scientific evidence informing message design and protocols to reduce, and possibly to prevent, over-alerting.   title: viewer preferences for next-generation media content during severe weather  principal investigator: holly obermeier (ou/ciwro)  proposed duration: july 1, 2022 - june 30, 2023  project summary:   the next-generation broadcast standard, advanced television systems committee (atsc) 3.0, will allow broadcast media to provide geo-targeted rich media content to an unlimited number of televisions, connected cars, and handheld devices before, during, and after emergencies, even when cellular-based systems are overloaded or down. atsc 3.0 will be built to the common alerting protocol standard and designed for seamless incorporation into the us integrated public alert and warning system. a primary question posed to the social science community by atsc 3.0 partners is what rich media content do viewers need to help them take appropriate protective actions during severe convective weather.   funding is being requested in this proposal to investigate viewer preferences for graphics, text, and level of interactivity with severe weather data received through atsc 3.0. through focus groups, researchers will explore what information viewers want to access, what information they pay most attention to, and how that information affects their behavioral intent. these focus group discussions will also investigate trusted sources of information and add to our knowledge about how people interact with visual information, regardless of medium.   the cooperative institute for severe and high-impact weather research and operations (ciwro), in collaboration with nssl, nebraska public media, and nbc universal, proposes to conduct focus groups in lincoln, nebraska to explore preferences for rich media content and develop prototypes for atsc 3.0 through an iterative feedback process.  focus groups will be led by pi obermeier using pen-and-paper design sessions to identify the content that people would actively search for during severe convective weather (information about the threat, potential impacts/consequences, location/population at risk, recommended protective actions), how they prefer to receive/view that information (static or dynamic text, audio, video, graphics, maps, interactive display, etc.), and the format by which they prefer to receive/view information (television broadcast, phone alert, radio, etc.).   we are requesting funds for a subcontract to the university of albany, to investigate viewer preferences for, attention to, memory of, and decision making in response to severe convective weather data presented via an interactive display screen. researchers will manipulate content, style, structure, and design features through face-to-face eye tracking, think aloud interviews, and post-stimuli surveys. researchers will explore design parameters that lead to optimal performance, that is characteristics and features that facilitate attention, while reducing effort required to engage with and process information for decision making.   specifically, researchers will explore the presentation of severe weather data content (what information is presented to the viewer with varying levels of familiarity and reading level), style (how the information is presented using color, font size, style, and inter-word and inter-line spacing, and other graphical features), and structure (where information is presented on the display and in what order). design decisions will occur iteratively, first by conducting user-centered focus groups (led by ou/ciwro) and then through a series of lab-based experiments (led by ua).  lab-based experiments will be led by the sutton (ualbany team) and will focus on ease of information processing and heightened engagement by exploring: visual attention (eye-tracking to assess areas of interest, gaze patterns and scan paths, time to first fixation, and fluency) search priorities (think aloud interviews conducted during eye tracking activities and post-stimuli debriefing) short-term memory (free and cued recall post-stimuli) perceived effort, susceptibility, severity, and risk (survey questionnaire conducted post-stimuli)  experiments will be scenario driven (to structure search activities leading to decision making rather than casual perusal of information) and will be conducted under conditions of full and divided attention (to identify information processing capabilities and desire to engage with information).    requested budget  budget

    "alexander khmaladze": "  title page  nsf-bsf: novel optical markers for grading bladder tissues  overview: the  project’s goal  is  to hybridize two powerful, label-free  imaging  methodologies,  raman  spectroscopy (rs) and  interferometric  phase  microscopy  (ipm),  to perform unique  grading of diseased bladder tissue by correlating the raman chemical signatures with detailed  morphological analysis. the primary objective is to use the hybrid rs-ipm system to find stain- free optical biomarkers that can be used to predict recurrence, progression, or death in high grade  t1  (invasion  into  the  lamina  propria  layer) non-muscle  invasive  bladder disease. in addition,  a  novel study on interstitial cystitis (ic) will be performed to gain insight into this complex, poorly  understood, often   debilitating   bladder   disease. rs is   an   ideal   technique   for   molecular  fingerprinting, since it is sensitive to the chemical changes in cells and tissues and can be used  to separate healthy, benign and cancerous tissue regions. improvements in technology has led  to the development of “fit-for-purpose” raman systems, designed to be used in surgical theaters  and  doctors'  surgeries,  without  the  need  for  sending  samples  to  the  pathology  laboratory.  extensive studies in label-free tissue imaging with compact raman spectroscopic systems fitted  with fiber-optic probes have been reported. also, ipm has been previously proposed as a method  for tissue diagnosis in different malignancies. however, this optical technique has not been fully  explored in the bladder tissue space. ipm records a topographic map that represents, for each  spatial point, the integral of the refractive-index values along the cell thickness, thus accounting  for  both  the  cell internal  morphology  and  contents. the  combination  of  ipm  and  raman  spectroscopy for label-free tissue imaging is novel.   importantly, we will employ information-theoretic machine learning approaches and multivariant  analysis  to  our  data  processing.  this  will  allow  us  to  utilize  small  training  sets,  which  will  be  realistically available in the course of this project. we expect that the methodologies developed  in  this  proposal  will  be  broadly  applicable  to  other  tissues  and  cells  grown  in  3d  constructs.    the educational goal of this project is to facilitate training in the interdisciplinary fields of medicine,  biology, physics, mathematics, computer programming, and engineering.   intellectual  merit: in this  proposal,  we  suggest  developing the  methodology  based  on deep  convolutional neural networks applied directly to the ipm-based topographic maps and raman  spectra,  with  the  goal  of  cancer  cell  grading (normal/primary/metastatic  cancer) for  bladder  cancer. thus, success of the grant objectives is expected to yield a novel stain-free method for  correlating  tissue  responses  and  the  changes  in  its  chemistry  and  morphology,  which will  elucidate the underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer development.  broader impacts: out of all non-muscle invasive bladder cancers, high grade t1 (invasion into  the lamina propria layer) has the highest risk for progression to muscle invasive disease (27-65%)  and  death  (34%).  to date, there  are  no  accurate  markers  able  to  predict  recurrence,  progression or death in bladder cancer. prior clinical and pathologic markers examined have  not been accurate enough for clinical use. there is a dire need for predictive biomarkers in this  space. label-free imaging approaches are much preferred.  integration  of  education  and  research: the  pis  will offer local high school students,  from  regions with high populations of under-represented minorities, opportunities to participate in data  collection and/or  analysis  steps  either  in  person  or  through  virtual  settings  (due  to  covid-19).  these students will be paired with current lab members and create grade appropriate posters to  share their unique contribution at virtual and regional meetings. this program will (1) demystify  the research environment and stem fields for students. (2) show students how math, chemistry,  biology,  programing  and  physics  are  used  to  solve  complex real-world problems. (3) drive  community  awareness  of local research that  is immediately  applicable  to  their  lives,  done  by  approachable biomedical researchers, physicists, and engineers.        overview:   the  goal  of this project  is  to  elucidate  the  interplay  between  various  components  of  apoptosome  in  methamphetamine  (meth) treated  microglial  cells.  the  findings  will  establish  the  central  role  of  apoptosome  formation  and  function  in meth-induced cell  death.  meth  induced  neuro-inflammation  results in neuronal apoptosis causing neuro-cognitive dysfunction. evaluating meth-induced microglial  activation and associated changes in microglial morphology and immunophenotype in real time offers an  opportunity for comprehensive assessment of the severity and nature of meth-induced neurotoxicity in  the central nervous system. apoptosis in neurons is triggered by the release of cytochrome c (cyt-c) from  mitochondria,  which  interacts  with  apoptotic  protease  activating  factor-1  (apaf-1)  to  initiate  apaf-1  oligomerization  and  the  apoptosome  formation, leading  to  the  activation  of  caspase-9  followed  by  executioner caspase-3/7 activation. our preliminary findings demonstrate that meth treatment results in  microglial activation and upregulation of various components of the apoptosome such as apaf-1, caspase- 9,  and cyt-c.  apaf-1  is  a  key  regulator  of  apoptosome-mediated  caspase  activation.  examining the  intermediate steps in the apoptotic pathway that can prevent apoptosome assembly and apoptosis may help  us answer key questions, such as “does meth induced caspase activation cause a transient induction of  apoptosis, which can be reversed without resulting in cell death?”  we  hypothesize  that  examining  apoptosome  function  in real  time using  novel  molecular  and  bio- imaging methods, such as digital holography microscopy (dhm) and raman spectroscopy, will clarify  whether  neuronal  apoptosis  is  reversible, and  provide  insight  into the  specific components  in  apoptotic  pathways that can be targeted to reverse meth induced neuroinflammation and associated neurotoxicity.  to test our hypothesis, we will define the impact of stoichiometry and nucleotide regulation of apoptosome  assembly  in  meth  treated  microglial  cells,  evaluate  the  effect  of  meth  on  subcellular  distribution  of  nucleotides, and  its  impact  on  the  apoptosome  assembly  in  real  time.  this  will  determine  whether  physiological levels of nucleotides and their distribution exert an inhibiting effect on apoptosome formation  and function in microglial cells in real time. the educational goal of this project is to facilitate training in  the interdisciplinary fields of molecular-biology, physics, mathematics, and bio-engineering.   intellectual merit:   this multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional study will provide a detailed understanding on how meth  treatment modulates  apoptosome  formation/function  in  microglia. the  importance  of  cell  death  in  both  normal  physiological  processes  and  during  altered  biological  functions  suggests  that  understanding  apoptosis may result in important therapeutic advances in medicine, specifically, cancer cell elimination,  or stopping cell apoptosis.  broader impacts:   meth induces  neurotoxic  responses  in  the  human  brain  by  initiating  cellular  apoptosis,  resulting  in  neurodegeneration  and  neurocognitive  impairment. however,  understanding mechanisms  by  which  the  initiator caspases are activated by the apoptosomes remain elusive. using raman and dhm, this project  will  enable identifying conformational  changes  in  apaf-1 that drive  the  formation  of  the  caspase-9- activating apoptosome, and thus be able to monitor in real time how does the activated apaf-1 assembles  into an apoptosome.  integration of education and research:   the  pis  will offer local high school students,  from  regions  with  high  populations  of  under-represented  minorities, opportunities to participate in data collection and/or analysis steps either in person or through  virtual settings (due to covid-19). these students will be paired with current lab members and create grade  appropriate posters to share their unique contribution at virtual and regional meetings. this program will  (1) de-mystify the research environment and stem fields for students, and develop a passion for stem  fields early in their career. (2)  help students understand how different fields of study, such as mathematics,  chemistry, bio-engineering and physics, are integrated and used to solve complex real-world problems. (3)  drive community awareness of local research that is directly or indirectly applicable to their lives, done by  approachable biomedical researchers, physicists, and engineers.      overview  the research goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms of neuro-inflammation (ni) in a label- free manner by utilizing innovative optics-based methodologies. human pluripotent stem cells (hpsc) offer  exciting opportunities for modeling organ development and disease modeling. it is now possible to engineer  hpsc-derived, miniature cerebral  three-dimensional organoids  that  model  human  brain  subregions  and   can   even   model   ni. since ni   is   a   common   etiology   underlying   many   neurological pathologies,  understanding the early triggers of the process could lead to scientific breakthroughs. however, the cellular  and molecular complexity of ni, manifesting as accumulation of a wide range of metabolites that execute  ni, provides a barrier to developing treatments. these metabolites are typically measured using traditional  approaches (qrt-pcr, western blotting, flow cytometry, chemical analyses and elisa), which are either  destructive  and/or  in bulk,  and  provide  limited spatial  information, temporal  resolution,  or  multiplex   capability. we aim to develop a platform that can quantitatively, non-invasively, and reliably measure ni in  a  label-free  manner,  with  greatly  improved  temporal  and  spatial  resolution,  sensitivity,  and  multiplex   capability. our  highly  collaborative  team  includes  experts  in  raman  imaging,  neuroscience,  and  in  regenerative technology. in objective 1, we will develop this platform by relating conventionally retrieved  data (transcriptomics, protein secretion, cellular composition, metabolic analysis) to raman spectroscopy  analysis  during  cerebral  organoid  differentiation  and  controlled  ni.  in  objective  2,  we  aim  to  understand  how  non-invasive  reporter  gene  imaging  of  m1  (pro-inflammatory)  and  m2  (anti-inflammatory)  correlates   with raman signal and conventional measurements of ni. overall, we aim to further organoid technology  through  raman  spectroscopy,  reporter  gene  imaging, organoid  and  systems  biology,  and  metabolic   analysis. the  educational  objective of  this  project  is  to  facilitate  training  in  the  interdisciplinary  fields  of   biomedical sciences, molecular biology, physics, mathematics, and bio-engineering.  intellectual merit  our multidisciplinary proposal will advance the field of non-invasive human cerebral organoid assessment.  as  human  stem  cell-derived  organoids  have  become  more  widely  used,  methods  to  assess  them  non- invasively are a critical  area of development.  conventional methods include qrt-pcr, rna-seq, western  blots, and immunohistochemistry, but these are static and destructive. methods like elisa or other chemo- analysis  are  highly  quantitative,  but still provide only a  static,  bulk  measure  of  function  or  tissue   environment. on the other hand, non-invasive real-time, serial, quantitative multiplex raman spectroscopy  preserves the underlying biology and enables the serial analysis of native biological processes over time.  existing  techniques  like  multiphoton  microscopy  or  light-sheet  microscopy  require  the  use  of  dye,  or  fluorescent reporter gene expression and  do not enable multiplex measurement. therefore, they convey  little  molecular  information  regarding  multiple  underlying  metabolites.  here  we  propose  employing  non- invasive raman   spectroscopy,   which   will   provide   non-invasive, multiplex   (many   simultaneous    measurements) spectral,  assessment  of  chemical  environment  during  the  initiation,  maintenance,  and   resolution  of  ni. the  use  of  raman  in  the  model  systems  that  model  ni  enable  offers  a  new  platform   technology that can lead to new identification of targets, new biology of ni, and eventually, new therapeutic  avenues for these unsolved problems.  broader impacts.  regenerative medicine and stem cells can have a large impact on public health through understanding of  tissue  injury  and  therapy,  aging,  human  development,  disease  modeling.  human  stem  cells  also  offer   unprecedented  access  to  human  tissues  that  enables  improved  models  for  drug  development  and  basic   science. of particular interest are neurological diseases which have no cure, and greatly affect the aging  population. by tackling the development of a platform for ni in this proposal, we are addressing a common  mechanism  in  many  neurological  diseases  that  affect  society,  including prion  disease,  alzheimer’s,  zika   virus, hereditary autoimmune disease, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, hiv-1, schizophrenia, and autism.    integration of education and research  the pis will offer local high school students and undergraduate students from regions with high populations  of under-represented minorities opportunities to participate in steps of data collection and/or analysis, either  in person or through virtual settings (due to covid-19). these students will be paired with current graduate  laboratory members. they will then create grade-appropriate posters to share their unique contribution at  virtual and regional meetings. this program will also drive community awareness of local research that is  applicable to our nation’s well-being.        label-free detection of iron binding proteins in intact cells  overview  the  project’s  goal  is  to  use an innovative  methodology,  raman  spectroscopic  hyperspectral   imaging,  to  label  the  distribution  of  iron  binding  proteins  in  intact  cells  and  tissues.  iron  is  an   essential  micronutrient  and  is  associated  with  many  important  biological  functions,  such  as   respiration  and  cell  division.  currently,  there  is  no  robust  method  to  visualize  and  quantify  the  distribution of iron-binding proteins in intact cells and tissues. two iron binding proteins that have  essential role in iron metabolism are the iron storage protein, ferritin, and iron transporting protein,  transferrin. as we have previously demonstrated [1,2] in our publications in redox biology (impact  factor 11.8) and free radical biology and medicine (impact factor 7.4), raman hyperspectral  imaging detects spectral peaks that can be correlated with iron-bound transferrin. recently, our  raman studies have shown substantial differences in spectra of both transferrin and ferritin with  and without bound iron, thus proving that it is an appropriate technique to determine the levels of  bound iron in these protein mixtures.   in  this  study,  we  will leverage  raman  hyperspectral  imaging  as  a  nonionizing,  label-free,  and   highly  specific  technique  for  molecular  characterization  of  iron-binding  associated  proteins  in  a   wide variety of cell types and tissues. importantly, we will be able to rapidly acquire, process and  multiplex  hyperspectral  images  of  a  panel  of  cellular  iron-binding  proteins  without  the  need  for   dye labeling with high chemical selectivity. we will expand our work to identify multiple raman  peaks and correlate them to different iron binding protein (transferrin, ferritin, ferroportin, heme)  to accomplish simultaneous imaging of these proteins by raman hyperspectral imaging.  intellectual merit  our  interdisciplinary  team  will  develop  raman  microscopy  subcellular  mapping  approaches  in   intact unlabeled  cells  and  tissues  to:  (1)  visualize  and  quantify  the  iron-binding  status  and   subcellular location of iron-binding proteins; (2) identify a ferroptosis-dependent cellular profile,  based   on   iron-binding   protein   and   lipid   peroxidation   changes.   it   will   also   advance   our    understanding of  diseases  caused  by  iron  deficiency  (anemias)  and  iron  overload  (hereditary   hemochromatosis).  successful  completion  of  this  work  will  provide  a  new  paradigm  for   understanding the regulation of intracellular transport of iron.  broader impacts  iron  is  located  at  the  center  of  the  heme  complex,  and  heme  is  a  crucial

hypofunction. regenerative medicine can offer innovative strategies capable of restoring salivary gland function in patients that have few alternatives. we are developing bioengineered organoids that will differentiate when implanted in vivo to partially restore salivary function. this multidisciplinary proposal combines research expertise of the pi and his collaborators for the development of bioengineered organoids that are designed to be implanted in vivo to partially restore salivary function. in complex organoids derived from adult cells that include both primary mesenchyme and epithelial cells, treatment with fibroblast growth factor stimulates proacinar differentiation; however, not all cells are responsive, and only viable proacinar organoids should be implanted in vivo. since standard methods for assessing cell phenotype are destructive, there is an unmet need for monitoring viability and state of organoids or cell-scaffold constructs non-invasively prior to implantation into a mouse model or, ultimately, into patients. while the classification of tissue engineered constructs has been traditionally performed by confocal microscopy, via histological assessment, or by measuring glucose consumption, none of these invasive methods are suitable for analyzing tissues prior to in vivo implantation. raman spectroscopy offers an important noninvasive tool capable of assessing cell phenotype. when cell morphology and phenotype change, this process is accompanied by changes in the protein structure within the cells.  we have previously shown that changes in secondary/tertiary protein structure can be detected by raman spectroscopy even in tissue engineered constructs before they can be seen histologically. here, we develop salivary organoids derived from embryonic progenitor cells that undergo differentiation in culture on their own and in the presence of nanofiber scaffolds. our primary hypothesis is that differentiation-induced chemical changes in bioengineered salivary gland organoid constructs is detectable with raman spectroscopy.  the goal of this project is to identify a set of raman signatures that can be used to monitor the differentiation state of salivary gland organoids and to test the performance of these raman indicators for predicting the state of bioengineered salivary gland organoid constructs at the cellular level. we propose an innovative, multidisciplinary strategy to identify raman spectroscopic signatures for proacinar differentiation in adult salivary gland organoids and bioengineered glands. these studies pave the way for future work to test if raman spectroscopy can be used as an early predictor of the ultimate success of an in vivo implanted construct.   summary the project's goal is to find stain-free optical biomarkers in prostate cancer (cap) by combining by two powerful, label-free imaging methodologies, raman spectroscopy (rs) and phase microscopy (pm). rs is an ideal technique for molecular fingerprinting, since it is sensitive to the changes in the molecular composition of tissue, which occurs in disease progression. pm offers information on morphological features, thus facilitating the correlation of raman signatures with specific morphological changes in cells and tissue. the rs-pm data analysis will be done by extracting features and performing principal component analysis (pca), followed by a support vector machine (svm). importantly, we will then determine the raman/pm classifier accuracy of predicting aggressiveness of cancer. our primary hypothesis is that changes in protein, nucleus structure, cellular morphology, vascularization, lipid droplet distribution and formation and arrangement of cells within tissues, which are associated with cap aggressiveness can be detected with the combined raman spectroscopy and phase imaging. many research groups have reported extensive studies in imaging label-free tissues and cells using compact raman spectroscopic systems fitted with fiber-optic probes. these measurements produce a set of raman signatures that are used for tissue characterization. ipm records a topographic map that represents, for each spatial point, the integral of the refractive-index values along the cell thickness, thus accounting for both the cell internal morphology and contents. it has been previously proposed as a method for tissue diagnosis in different malignancies but has not been explored in the prostate cancer space. a combined approach integrating pm and rs for simultaneous label-free tissue imaging is novel and is expected to produce morphological and chemical data that together will deliver a set of biomarkers suitable for prostate cancer tissue analysis. this project will produce a technique suitable for studying other tissues-related processes using the combination of raman and ipm. parallel detection by ipm and raman allows us to monitor both morphology and chemistry of biomolecules with a temporal resolution of a few minutes, without the need for staining, which is generally impossible with other techniques. we expect that the methodologies developed in this proposal will be broadly applicable to other tissues and malignancies. if these techniques are proved to be useful, commercially available hardware for raman imaging (which many labs have now) can be acquired for the price similar to a \"regular\" confocal microscope, enabling their extensive use. the long-term goal of this research is to broadly introduce raman and pm into hospital facilities, where they can be used by physicians to determine what tissues to remove during surgeries and adjust the treatment in real time, which will greatly improve patient outcomes.   nsf-bsf: novel optical markers for grading bladder tissues overview: the project's goal is to hybridize two powerful, label-free imaging methodologies, raman spectroscopy (rs) and interferometric phase microscopy (ipm), to perform unique grading of diseased bladder tissue by correlating the raman chemical signatures with detailed morphological analysis. the primary objective is to use the hybrid rs-ipm system to find stain-free optical biomarkers that can be used to predict recurrence, progression, or death in high grade t1 (invasion into the lamina propria layer) non-muscle invasive bladder disease. in addition, a novel study on interstitial cystitis (ic) will be performed to gain insight into this complex, poorly understood, often debilitating bladder disease. rs is an ideal technique for molecular fingerprinting, since it is sensitive to the chemical changes in cells and tissues and can be used to separate healthy, benign and cancerous tissue regions. improvements in technology have led to the development of \"fit-for-purpose\" raman systems, designed to be used in surgical theaters and doctors' surgeries, without the need for sending samples to the pathology laboratory. extensive studies in label-free tissue imaging with compact raman spectroscopic systems fitted with fiber-optic probes have been reported. also, ipm has been previously proposed as a method for tissue diagnosis in different malignancies. however, this optical technique has not been fully explored in the bladder tissue space. ipm records a topographic map that represents, for each spatial point, the integral of the refractive-index values along the cell thickness, thus accounting for both the cell internal morphology and contents. the combination of ipm and rs for label-free tissue imaging is novel.  importantly, we will employ robust machine learning approaches and multivariant analysis in our data processing. this will allow us to utilize small training sets, which will be realistically available in the course of this project. we expect that the methodologies developed in this proposal will be broadly applicable to other tissues and cells grown in 3d constructs.   the educational goal of this project is to facilitate training in the interdisciplinary fields of medicine, biology, physics, mathematics, computer programming, and engineering.  intellectual merit: in this proposal, we suggest developing the methodology based on deep convolutional neural networks applied directly to the ipm-based topographic maps and raman spectra, with the goal of cancer cell grading (normal/primary/metastatic cancer) for bladder cancer. thus, success of the grant objectives is expected to yield a novel stain-free method for correlating tissue responses and the changes in its chemistry and morphology, which will elucidate the underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer development. broader impacts: out of all non-muscle invasive bladder cancers, high grade t1 (invasion into the lamina propria layer) has the highest risk for progression to muscle invasive disease (27-65%) and death (34%). to date, there are no accurate markers able to predict recurrence, progression, or death in bladder cancer. prior clinical and pathologic markers examined have not been accurate enough for clinical use. there is a dire need for predictive biomarkers in this space. label-free imaging approaches are much preferred. integration of education and research: the pis will offer local high school students, from regions with high populations of under-represented minorities, opportunities to participate in data collection and/or analysis steps. these students will be paired with current lab members and create grade appropriate posters to share their unique contribution at national and regional meetings. this program will (1) demystify the research environment and stem fields for students. (2) show students how math, chemistry, biology, programing and physics are used to solve complex real-world problems. (3) drive community awareness of local research that is immediately applicable to their lives, done by approachable biomedical researchers, physicists, and engineers.   ",
    "ho kwan cheung": "project summary statement of problem diversity within american society is a reality, and the need to manage it in the workplace is growing in light of anti-racism and #metoo movements. although many organizations turn to diversity training as a key component of their larger diversity initiatives, research evidence for its effectiveness has been inconclusive at best, necessitating improvements for efforts to curb discrimination. in the proposed research, we argue that one way to effectively reduce discrimination is to align the intervention with the strongest underlying social-cognitive mechanism. we propose that because discrimination is a result of biased and automatic cognition and attitudes, it may be disrupted by the practice of mindfulness, which stresses present-moment awareness and non-judgmental acceptance. because mindfulness can reduce automated behaviors and increase self-regulation, mindfulness skill-based training may reduce the likelihood of people instinctively relying on biased cognitions and enacting prejudice when interacting with diverse others. we will test our ideas with a series of three empirical studies that combine different experimental design and longitudinal data collection across different samples in order to maximize the robustness of our findings to inform diversity science.  intellectual merit first, the proposed project draws from social categorization and impression management theories, as well as year-1 pilot data, to demonstrate that mindfulness skill-based training may be an effective tool to disrupt prejudice and combat discrimination. thus, the current research has strong theoretical rationale and preliminary data for support. second, we extend the existing focus of mindfulness research from intrapersonal to interpersonal settings and develop present-moment awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance skills that can be used to disrupt discrimination. consequently, the proposed research not only extends present mindfulness theory, but also applies this theory using a cross-domain approach. third, by taking a self-regulation view to understand the process of discrimination, the proposed research shifts the focus from targets to perceivers (i.e., those who may discriminate), thus lightening the burden of targets who already have to manage their out-group (and often stigmatized) identities. this results in evidence-based recommendations for non-minority members to use when working to combat their own expressions of prejudice and discrimination. fourth, our use of experimental design across student and working adult samples allows for triangulation of conclusions using multiple sources of data to help ensure the robustness of our findings to advance the current understanding of discrimination reduction.  broader impact the impact of the current research is far-reaching. first, it will link a psychological mechanism to an intervention (e.g., mindfulness) and influence diversity-related behaviors--a substantial theoretical and practical contribution. second, this work will guide the development of future discrimination-reduction interventions, by demonstrating how to best curb the psychological attribution for prejudice. third, the proposed research examines if this effect generalizes in the hospitality industry, which is a highly customer-facing service industry. fourth, it adopts a mixed-method, virtual methodology, which could provide evidence to bolster the effectiveness of interventions implemented in an online environment--particularly relevant in ongoing and post-pandemic workplaces. finally, fifth, it integrates a popular practice, mindfulness, which has received heightened practical and research attention over the last ten years and generated a devoted group of practitioners. if the proposed study generates evidence about the utility of mindfulness in interventions aimed at reducing discrimination, there is great opportunity for interdisciplinary and practical overlap that could have downstream impact.

    "benjamin schweinhart": "project summary  overview: this project will support the widespread adoption of metal additive manufacturing (am) by developing a rigorous methodology to quantitatively compare material microstructures by grain geometries and phase distributions. am refers to a set of rapidly developing technologies that allow three-dimensional objects to be fabricated by depositing successive layers of material according to a digital model. this is particularly attractive for complicated high-value parts that need to be fabricated in relatively small volumes, as is evidenced by the aerospace and medical industries' interest in metal am. that said, there are a variety of barriers that need to be overcome for metal am to be more widely adopted, three of which are relevant to this proposal. first, simulations to understand the effect of processing parameters on the microstructures of am parts are often incompletely verified. second, am parts often exhibit higher microstructure and performance variability than conventionally-manufactured ones, and uncertainty propagation models need to quantify microstructure uncertainty before propagating this to the material properties. third, there is an urgent need for qualification standards for metal am, particularly since there can be substantial machine-to-machine variability. including comparisons to a reference microstructure in emerging standards could substantially reduce the number of tests required for equivalence-based qualification.  intellectual merit: existing approaches in the literature for quantification of am microstructures usually involve the comparison of ad hoc selections of distributions empirically observed to be related to material properties, e.g., the grain size distribution, the spatial distribution of solute species, or the particle size distribution of a second phase. however, the these are not consistent across the literature, are not necessarily meaningful or defined for every material, and leave considerable ambiguity in the microstructures being compared. the proposed methodology would allow these comparisons to be made consistent and precise. this includes the development of two metrics on microstructures. the first is the volume exchange metric, and is intuitively the minimum amount of volume that must be swept out by the grain boundaries to transform one microstructure into another. the second is the topographic metric, and is intuitively the cost of transforming the distance function to the grain boundaries of one microstructure into that of another. the availability of comprehensive metrics like the ones proposed and implemented here would enable more quantitative comparison of simulated microstructures with experiments, provide a natural approach to quantify the variability of microstructures by means of representative volume elements, and perhaps encourage reference microstructures to be included in qualified metallurgical processes.  broader impacts: the project would open a number of further research directions that would contribute to the continued technological leadership of the united states. specifically, a precise understanding of the effect of processing parameters on microstructural features would in principle allow engineers to specify the material properties at every point within a manufactured part. this requires, at a minimum, the ability to verify that a given set of processing parameters on a given machine results in the expected microstructure. the proposed research is therefore prerequisite to realizing the fullest potential of am.   the project will support the training of two doctoral students and two undergraduate students, to support the expansion of students' research interests, to offer training in computational and statistical methods, and to increase awareness of the developing field of mathematical materials science. in addition, both pis teach graduate courses on related subjects. b. schweinhart teaches a master's level course on topological and geometric data analysis\" for which he plans to add a module on shape metrics and microstructure geometry, including some of the proposed ideas. j.k. mason teaches a course on \"computational materials science\" for which he plans to develop a module where students would directly compare simulated microstructures with corresponding experimental ones.    project summary — topology of random structures b. schweinhart (pi) and  ́ e. rold ́an (senior personnel) percolation  and  random  growth  models  are  fundamental  in  statistical  mechanics,  mathematical physics,  and  probability.   they  produce  structures  with  intricate  geometry  and  topology,  which is  both  of  inherent  mathematical  interest  and  is  related  to  classically  studied  properties.   the proposal explores topology of random structures in two settings:  percolation in higher dimensions and  random  stochastic  growth  models.   the  former  concerns  phase  transitions  marked  by  the appearance  of  “giant”  loops,  sheets  (figure  1a),  and  higher  dimensional  topological  features  in random models.  the latter concerns structures built by adding cells one-at-a-time to an existing structure;  the  proposal  modifies  the  model  illustrated  in  figure  1b  to  produce  structures  with unusual  topology  and  geometry.   as  broader  impacts,  the  proposal  includes  the  creation  of  a website for outreach and mathematics popularization that will include interviews and interactive 3d models showcasing the beautiful geometric structures for a general audience.

    "thomas begley": "abstract  enzyme-catalyzed rna modifications, or epitranscriptomic marks, are important gene regulatory signals, with defects linked to altered development, intellectual impairment, and cancer.   we have previously used mass-spectrometry based epitranscriptomic analysis of model systems (bacteria, yeast, mice, and human cells) to show that epitranscriptomic systems use dynamic rna modifications with altered base pairing rules to regulate the expression of gene expression networks. while our mass-spectrometry based results have revealed important clues to the role of uridine marks, there are over 100 other known rna modifications leaving unanswered questions about what these additional marks do and how they work? improvements in our understanding of the biomedical roles of rna modifications is limited by: (1) lack of chemically synthesized rna modification standards for biochemical analysis; (2) a restricted ability to detect the sequence context of some rna modifications inside the cell; (3) underdeveloped computational methods to predict sequencing properties of rna modifications; and (4) studies to test the roles of rna modification systems in disease progression. our goal is to expand our existing epitranscriptomic characterization pipeline to define the base pairing, sequencing properties and biological context of specific cytosine (c) and adenosine (a) based epitranscriptomic marks. c and a parent nucleosides were elected because of the versatile reactivity that their aromatic amino-groups provide for installation and removal of epitranscriptomic marks, and the corresponding modified nucleobases play important biological roles in signaling and development. we will optimize computational and laboratory tools to model, detect and identify modified nucleic acids from mass spectrometry and sequencing data. we have recently determined that many epitranscriptomic marks are dysregulated in myotonic dystrophy, a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by expansion of a ctg repeat that causes rna processing and splicing defects and a non-canonical repeat associated non-aug (ran) translation.    we will use computational, genetic and nucleoside detection approaches in three aims that harness in silico, in vitro and in situ systems to define the roles of rna modifications in myotonic dystrophy.      abstract    epitranscriptomic marks in the form of enzyme catalyzed rna modifications are dynamic signals that  can regulate gene expression and deficiencies have been linked to cancer, ageing and developmental diseases.    our current application seeks to define how epitranscriptomic marks are reprogrammed to modify the  effects  of pharmaceuticals.  we  have  recently  performed  total  rna  epitranscriptomic  analysis  and  demonstrated that the rna modifications 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm 5 u) and 3-methylcytidine (m 3 c)  are increased in the livers of mice  treated with an acute toxic dose of acetaminophen (apap).  we have chosen  to study apap because of its widespread use as a pain reliever, the high dose hepatoxicity that causes over  50% of the acute liver failure in the u.s., and the wealth of chemical and biological data on apap that can be  used to contextualize our epitranscriptomic data. the mcm 5 u modification is written into the wobble position 34  of trna arg & sec  by alkylation repair homolog  (alkbh8), while m 3 c is written by methyltransferase-like (mettl)  2  and mettl6 at position 32 of  trna thr  and trna ser, , respectively, and into mrna and rrna by mettl8.    we  have demonstrated that mcm 5 u writer deficient mice (alkbh8 def ) have increased sensitivity and biomarkers of  apap damage, relative to wild type controls.  further, we have used chemically synthesized rna, base pairing  and reverse transcription assays to demonstrate the m 3 c disrupts duplex formation and that depending on the  reverse transcriptase, n 3 -methylation specifies the c:a pair or reverse transcription stops.  we hypothesize that  the epitranscriptomic response to apap can regulate anticodon-codon pairing and the translation of apap- response proteins, and that writer deficiencies will promote apap toxicity.  further we propose to map the basal  and  apap-induced  m 3 c  rnaome and determine  if  mrna or  rrna modifications are used to  regulate  the  expression of enzymes that bioactivate, detoxify or modulate the effects of apap.  our studies will be the first to  define  the  epitranscriptomic  response  to  apap,  elucidating  roles for rna  modifications  and  writers  in  the  translation of therapeutically important proteins.         project:  epitranscriptomic regulation of ros   statement of work (ualbany portion of study) professor begley will be a sub award investigator with oversight of the mouse studies and grant management at ualbany.  professor begley will plan and supervise the execution of mouse studies, which includes breeding and husbandry.  professor begley will also work with project team to provide study updates at joint lab meetings and to publish their findings.      project:  epitranscriptomic regulation of ros   statement of work (ualbany portion of study) professor begley will be a sub award investigator with oversight of the mouse studies and grant management at ualbany.  professor begley will plan and supervise the execution of mouse studies, which includes breeding and husbandry.  professor begley will also work with project team to provide study updates at joint lab meetings and to publish their findings.

    "annalisa scimemi": "  abstract  three  aims  are  proposed  to  that  apply  hipsc  technologies  and  multiomics  to  investigate  signaling   pathways   acting   in   multiple   affected   or   non-affected   cns   brain   regions   in   age-  and   ad-related  neurodegeneration or neuroprotective signaling. advanced protocols have emerged in the stem cell field,  which developmentally reflect regionally specific neural cells and organoid structures. in this proposal, we  will evaluate hipsc derived cns neural populations representing cells of multiple brain regions that are  neocortex,  forebrain  medial  ganglionic  eminence,  hippocampus,  midbrain  substantia  nigra and  spinal   cord. of  primary interest  is  nachr  pathways,  which  we  have  expertise  as  well  as  distinct  or  interacting   pathways. we hypothesize regional differences will exist and be informative in categorizing pathway roles  to benefit therapeutics.  role of astrocyte and neuron eaat2/glt1 failure in alzheimer's disease pathogenesis  it has long been appreciated that astrogliosis (defined by elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein, gfap expression) is a robust feature of alzheimer's disease (ad) attending amyloid-β (aβ) and phospho-tau pathology. historically, astrogliosis has received much less attention than neuron and synapse loss/dysfunction. this is due in part to extensive gfap expression that demonstrates astrocytes are not lost in ad, thereby raising questions about the relative importance of this cell type in ad. in addition, until more recently much of the ad work examining astrocytes has been somewhat focused on gfap, which does not have a clearly understood function, nor does it appear to be essential for neuroinflammatory processes in the brain. as a result there remain important gaps in our understanding of how astrocytes, which are crucial for normal brain function, contribute to ad pathogenesis.  one of the most crucial functions of astrocytes is to clear synaptically-released glutamate from extracellular spaces. importantly, we and other groups have shown that even relatively modest changes in the rate at which extracellular glutamate is cleared promotes neurotoxic processes, degrades spatial/temporal specificity in synaptic networks, and elevates metabolic burden due to excess excitatory brain activity. the most important proteins in the brain for regulating glutamate homeostasis comprise a small family of glutamate transporters, of which eaat2/glt1 is by far the most abundant in brain regions such as the hippocampus and cortex. more recently, it has been shown that a small proportion of glt1, previously thought to be localized only in astrocytes, is also expressed in neuronal presynaptic terminals (5-10% of all glt1 molecules) and its loss leads to late-onset spatial reference long-term memory deficits. in neurons, glt1 is found in glutamatergic terminals, where we have found it promotes excitatory neurotransmitter vesicle refill. by contrast, in astrocytes, glutamate taken up by glt1 is metabolized to glutamine, a substrate for the biosynthesis of glutamate and gaba. therefore, astrocytic glt1 supports both excitation and inhibition in the brain. a wide-ranging and coherent body of data from the research team in this proposal has evidence that:  (i)  inhibiting glt1 strongly reduces inhibitory gabaergic transmission in the hippocampus. (ii) a42 disturbs post-translational glt1 processing and markedly slows down synaptically-released glutamate clearance in hippocampal slices.  (iii) early-occurring deficits and aberrant structural properties of glt1 in brains from ad patients correspond with increasing cognitive impairment. in addition, loss of astrocytic glt1 mimics gene expression changes that are well matched with those in ad. our preliminary data suggest that in ad patients, there are significant changes in astrocyte morphology and aberrant glt1 localization that are in keeping with ex vivo findings in aβ-treated mouse hippocampal slices.  collectively, these data raise a number of important questions that are the focus of this proposal: how do aβ42 and tau (p301l) affect neuronal and astrocytic glt1, and alter glutamate clearance and excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmission? what mechanisms drive dysfunction of the neuronal and astrocytic glt1 pools by aβ42 and tau-p301l? what are the consequences of aβ42 and tau-p301l expression on gene expression in astrocytes and neurons?  when in the disease process does astrocytic dysmorphology and disturbed glutamate transporter association with the synaptic parenchyma occur? the questions above will be addressed in three specific aims: specific aim 1:  we will identify how neuronal and astrocytic glt1 loss alters glutamate clearance and gabaergic inhibition onto ca1 pyramidal cells. we will perform electrophysiology recordings from neurons and astrocytes in conditional mice lacking neuronal or astrocytic glt1 (syncre/+:glt1-/- and gfapcre/+:glt1/, respectively). we will use cross-linking glt1 antibodies to determine how inhibiting membrane diffusion of glt1 contributes to the effect of neuronal and astrocytic glt1 on gabaergic inhibition. specific aim 2: using astrocyte and neuronal glt1-/- mice, we will determine how aav mediated aβ42 and tau-p301l influence post-translational integrity of glt1 and the genetic profiles properties of neurons and astrocytes. we will use state-of-the-art flow cytometry in pooled and single cell populations to understand how neuronal and astrocytic glt1 loss alters posttranslational glutamate transporter status and genetic pathways in key cell types.   specific aim 3: to establish the translational significance of our published and preliminary ex vivo and in vivo findings, we will determine if increasing cognitive impairment corresponds with increasing peri-synaptic and peri-vascular astrocyte dysmorphology, disorganization of the highly specialized polarization of glutamate transporters in astrocytes, as well as altering the number and morphology of inhibitory interneurons in very well-characterized ad, cdr 0.5 (mild cognitively impaired), and age-matched normal controls.      2    specific aims. we recently demonstrated the ability of human induced pluriopotent stem cell (hipsc)-derived  neurons matured ex  vivo and encapsulated as pre-formed transplantable neuronal circuitry networks to  survive, retain synapses and integrate with host tissues in a rat c4 hemicontusion model of spinal cord injury  (sci) along with functional improvement. this is the first realization of transplantable neural circuitry and a key  technology  that  we  will further  develop in  two  focused  aims  of  this proposal.  central  nervous  system  (cns)  neural  circuitry  for  spinal  cord  regeneration  in  adulthood  is  regionally complex,  creating  challenges  for  repair  after injury and restoration of neural connectivity and function. transformative to stem cell derived therapies for  sci are  new neurodevelopment-based  protocols being studied and  optimized by  the  paluh  lab and  others.  specifically,  the use  of  neuromesodermal  progenitors  (nmps)  for  generation  of  trunk  and  spinal  lineages to  generate regionally  matched  homotypic spinal  motor  neurons  (smns) and  other  neural  cells. although  multipotent neural stem cells (nscs) have alternatively been used in sci studies, protocols without nmps lack  natural developmental trunk and spine specifications. also challenging is in vivo differentiation of nscs within  a  complex,  cytokine-releasing sci microenvironment, that  generates stochastic  outcomes  and  incomplete  differentiation allowing tumorigenicity. transplantable  neuronal  circuitry,  termed  neural  ribbons, provides pre- defined,  synaptically  active  networks  of ~5,000-10,000  cells that when  delivered  to  the  subacute phase  contused injury cavity align along the edge of host tissues that facilitates host-graft integration. neural ribbons  are   also   stable   shipping   platforms   that   benefit   collaborative   efforts. we  hypothesize  that to   address  optimization  and  scalability  of neuronal  circuitry  in  neural  ribbons for  sci  therapeutics,  detailed  investigation  into the  context  of  neurons  and interneurons,  oligodendrocyte  progenitor  cells  (opcs) or  myelinating  oligodendrocytes is required. this proposal builds from multiple published works that  validate  the  potential  of  neural ribbons in vitro and in in vivo rodent models of sci. by focusing here on in vitro advancement of neural  ribbon   technology we   will resolve   remaining   questions   around   cell   types   in   ratios and context,  neuromodulation, to  benefit  optimization  and scalability  for  future  focused  animal  studies. this  proposal  will  provide  an  essential framework  for  the  sci  field  to  bring  early  uniformity  to  animal  studies  applying  transplantable pre-formed neuronal circuitry technology of neural ribbons as well as provide an in vitro platform  for  analysis  of  connectivity  enhancing neuromodulation  via reagents,  electrostimulation  or optogenetics. we  have  in  hand  a  suite  of innovative  technologies, track  record  of  collaborative expertise,  productivity  and student training excellence. we propose two focused aims.    aim  1: optimization  of neural  ribbon  circuitry and scalability in the context  of nmp-derived neurons  and myelinating  oligodendrocytes. to  accelerate  3d  neural  ribbon  technology  for  the  sci  field we  will  optimize  smn  synaptogenesis  and  interactions  with  myelinating  oligodendrocytes  to  promote  neural  circuitry  connectivity and define scalability in regard to the neural cell context with opcs and astrocytes.  plasticity of  neural networks and network connectivity will be evaluated by multiple parameters, including synaptogenesis,  calcium   signaling,   axonal   myelination,   and   metabolism. students   are   trained in human   stem   cell  neurotechnologies  along  with a  suite of  methodologies required  for  comprehensive neural  cell  types  and  network analysis including:  cell  type-specific  biomarkers  (synapses,  channels,  gfap,  myelin,  etc)  by  cell  biology  and  immunofluorescence  as  well  as  scrna-seq  and  bioinformatics;  and  cell  type  and  network  functional  validations  (calcium  signaling,  glutamate  responsive  firing,  etc.),  as  well  as  biomaterials  (alginate  encapsulation)  and  metabolism  (seahorse). completion  of  this  aim  will  accelerate use  of  neural  ribbon  technology  for  the  sci  field  by optimizing neural  ribbon circuitry conditions and  neural  cell  interactions  for  scaling to larger animal studies.    aim   2: neuromodulation on   neural   ribbon   plasticity   and   circuitry. we   will quantify   effects   of  neuromodulation of  neural  ribbon  circuitry from aim1 by  electrostimulation. we  will  generate  the  platform  for  neuromodulation in house at suny polytechnic college of nanoscale science and engineering (cnse) that is  a  world-class  facility for micro  and nanoelectronics.  to  expand  our  ability  to  monitor  synaptogenesis  in  living  cells  we  will  generate synaptohysin  pre-synaptic  and  psd-95  post-synaptic  reporters  using  commercial  crispr-cas9  reagents  for  genome  editing. this  will  complement  other  cell-type  reporting. we previously  transduced hipscs with premade lv-cag-egfp lentivirus to generate trackable gfp-opcs. students expand  their  training  to  include enhanced strategies  for nanoelectronics  and  electrostimulation,  genome  editing  and  use of reporters.      statement of work  the leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 member a (lrrc8a) is an essential subunit of volume-regulated anion channel (vrac). vrac is indispensable for cell volume homeostasis but its contribution to other physiological processes remains a matter of investigation. conditional lrrc8a deletion in brain astrocytes reduces neuronal excitability, impairs synaptic plasticity and memory, and protects against ischemic damage. the mongin lab at amc recently developed a brain-wide, nestin-driven deletion of lrrc8a (in mice referred to as blrrc8a ko).  mice devoid of brain lrrc8a were born close to the expected mendelian ratio, without overt histological abnormalities but die at postnatal weeks 6-8, due to seizures. my role in this project is to perform electrophysiology experiments from neurons, in acute hippocampal slices from blrrc8a ko mice and from mice in which nestin expression is only deleted in interneurons (referred to as inlrrc8a ko). these findings will shed light on the cellular mechanisms that alter cell excitability and synaptic function in the absence of lrrc8a.

    "benjamin shaw": "project summary/abstract the covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to the normal operations of colleges across the globe. in addition, many students who were employed have now lost their jobs as a result of the economic fallout from the pandemic, and many student's parents have also become unemployed. such disruptions and uncertainty in the lives of college students may be experienced as major stressors with the potential to cause serious and lasting mental health problems. while virtually all college students are likely to be challenged to some degree by the pandemic, we anticipate that the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on college students will vary across two key dimensions: a student's individual social status (e.g., race/ethnicity, parental education) and conditions of the places where a student resides (e.g., a campus' covid positivity rate and policy response; a hometown's positivity rate and unemployment rate). additionally, we expect these disparate impacts will grow over time, following the course of the pandemic and recovery. the overall objectives of this project are to track disparities over time in the psychosocial and mental health impacts of the covid-19 pandemic among current college students, and identify factors that contribute to these disparities. more specifically, we aim to: 1) track and account for social status-based disparities in the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on current college students and how they change over time; and 2) track and account for place-based disparities in the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on current college students and how they change over time. we will accomplish these aims through a three-wave survey of a random sample of students (n=2,000) enrolled in the state university of new york (suny), one of the largest and most diverse comprehensive university systems in the u.s. (including 4-year and community colleges), located in a state hit hardest in the early phases of the pandemic. we will use a stratified random sampling strategy with over-sampling of disparity populations to ensure representation across institution type and population subgroups. survey measures will include assessment of covid-related stressors, mental and physical health status, psychological and coping resources, and health behavior changes; we will also merge community- and campus-level information with individual-level survey data to examine place-based effects. our approach is innovative because it focuses on both individual- and place-based sources of disparities in trajectories of mental health and somatic complaints over the course of the pandemic among a heterogeneous sample of students from one of the largest university systems in the country. our approach is significant because it is expected to substantially advance our understanding of psychosocial and mental health disparities among young adults at a critical transition in their lives. ultimately, this proposed project will shed light on the resources that are needed to mitigate these disparities in order to prevent life-long consequences.

    "paul roundy": "  abstract    (1) mapp – comp 4: process-oriented diagnostics for noaa climate model improvement  and applications.   (2)  title: model diagnostics  of  uncoupled  low-frequency  tropical  upper  tropospheric  wind  anomalies  (3) paul e. roundy university at albany, state university of new york, proundy@albany.edu  (4) introduction to the problem:  understanding sources of climate model bias in the characteristics of persistent, slowly evolving  seasonal timescale climate anomalies of the tropical atmosphere may help us improve the models  and will also facilitate statistical bias corrections of model forecasts, thereby improving predictions  of related weather and climate signals around the world. preliminary results suggest that roughly  60%  of  variance  in  100-day lowpass  filtered  zonal  wind data in  the  upper  troposphere  on  the  equator is not coupled to tropical sea surface temperature (sst) patterns. these uncoupled signals  thus explain  more  variance  in  seasonal  timescale  atmospheric  circulation  patterns  than  any  phenomenon presently included in the model diagnostic task force (mdtf) diagnostic package.  beyond  the  quasi-biennial  oscillation (qbo),  these  uncoupled  signals  are  not  well  understood.  such signals can emerge from linear wave-mean flow interaction (which might be well simulated)  but  also  from  nonlinear  processes  that  include  moist  coupling  to  wave-mean  flow  interactions,  including  moist-coupled  breaking  waves.  relevant  waves  include  both  rossby  waves  in  the  presence of horizontal shear of the background wind, and gravity waves in the presence of vertical  shear of the horizontal wind. the project hypothesis is that model biases in simulation of uncoupled  low frequency signals emerge from poor simulation of the wave spectrum and of phenomena that  rectify  signals  in  higher  frequency  variability  onto  lower  frequencies,  such  as  eddy momentum  fluxes  and  wave  breaking. the  proposed  work  compares the characteristics  and spectra of such  uncoupled  low  frequency  tropical  atmospheric  signals  in  cmip-6  model data  against similar  statistics in observations and reanalysis datasets, and develops diagnostics to assess their leading  mechanisms and the model biases therein, with recommended best paths to bias mitigation.   (5) broader impacts and relevance:   slowly evolving climate anomalies of the tropics can contribute toward droughts, wet periods, and  seasonally  relevant  temperature  extremes around  the  world. improved  prediction  may  help  us  better  manage  water  resources and make  better  investment  choices. understanding  the  internal  variability of the atmosphere should thus be a core aspect of any program to improve models and  subseasonal to seasonal forecasting. the call for mapp competition 4 seeks proposals that yield  process oriented diagnostics to give better understanding of model biases in light of comparison  against observations. it also seeks proposals that focus on clearly-identified gaps in the existing  mdtf  software  package.  this  proposal  focuses  on  large-scale  low-frequency  signals  of  the  tropical  upper  tropospheric  zonal  wind  that  occur  linearly  independently  from  sst  anomalies.  these  signals  are  understudied,  but  they  associate  with  more  than  half  the  variance  in  global  seasonal timescale tropical upper tropospheric climate events. the project will assess the extent to  which  climate  models  simulate  these  events, and diagnose  the  momentum and  moisture budget  source terms to explain biases therein. the analysis will identify the leading source terms in model  equations that dominate the emergence of the error. the code used to identify these signals and  compare them between model datasets will be uploaded to github and connected to the mdtf  diagnostic package.       title: ensemble post processing to remove projections onto temporal spatial error  eigenvectors to optimize seasonal to subseasonal forecasts    investigator: paul e. roundy university at albany, state university of new york,  proundy@albany.edu    co-investigator: emerson n. lajoie at noaa/nws/ncep/cpc,  emerson.lajoie@noaa.gov    abstract    a  part  of  the  error  in  numerical  model weather  and  climate forecasts  extending  from  days  to  months into the future may tend to develop following particular geographical patterns that grow  with  time  to  some  saturation  point  and that  could  be  identified  at  the  time  forecasts  are  made.  identifying such patterns would allow us to remove part of the forecast signal most likely to be  wrong, leaving behind signals in which we can have the greatest confidence, together with random  noise. statistics of these evolving patterns of error will also provide scientists with insights about  how such errors tend to develop, and will also help users to anticipate what kinds of patterns in  model forecasts might be more likely to be wrong.     this project calculates the climatology of model error, along with the leading geographical patterns  of model error that grow and evolve with lead time. it then develops algorithms to identify these  patterns  in  forecasts  while  forecasts  are  being  made  and  before  validation  data  are  available  to  calculate model error directly. it then removes the projected error patterns from the forecast data,  and attempts to construct the most likely evolutions of likely outcomes that will evolve instead of  those  error  patterns.  code  produced  will  be  implemented  in  real  time  at  the noaa  climate  prediction center over a two year period.     proposal summary    the  mars  climate  sounder  on  the  mars  reconnaissance  orbiter  (mro)  has  provided  years  of  temperature sounding data through a deep section of its atmosphere. the orbit of the satellite was  fixed  to  specific  locations  at  given  times  of  the  mars  day.  thus,  large  tracks  of  the  planet  are  observed  during  some  parts  of  the  day,  while  other  regions  go  largely  unobserved  at  the  same  times. the proposed work fits the seasonal and diurnal cycles to the temperature data, then creates  a topographic model of surface temperature as a function of time of day and day of the mars year  to extend the partial climatology of temperature to a full global climatology. it will calculate the  seasonal  and  diurnal  cycles  of  variance  of  temperature,  to  place  confidence  bounds  on  the  temperature range across the planet at all times of day and year, across the planet.     the  project  will  take  the  following  general  steps:  download  the  surface  temperature  data  from  each sounding event from the new mexico state university repository to its closest point on a  2.5-degree latitude longitude grid.  data are collected on an earth day schedule. deconvolve the  seasonal/diurnal  timescale  from  earth  time,  sorting  data  into  a  longitude-latitude-time  array  by  mars day and in time steps aggregated by sixths of the day. use fourier regression, including all  available data at a given grid point to fit the long-term mean and seasonal cycle, including the first  few harmonics, at each sixth of the day. reconstruct the values of the calculated cycles at each  point on the planet with sufficient observations to achieve confidence. at each time of day and day  of  year,  using  the  smooth  seasonal/diurnal  cycle  data,  find  the  linear  regression  relationships  between  surface  elevation,  latitude,  and  topographic  characteristics  (e.g.,  crater  basins,  ice,  and  mountains), using elevation, the horizontal gradient of elevation, and the laplacian of elevation as  predictors of temperature. the laplacian of elevation represents well locally relevant features such  as mountains and craters, while the horizontal gradient of elevation diagnoses tilt toward or away  from the sun find the association of surface temperature to incoming solar insolation data and the  above variables, then use that relationship to fill the missing data regions. this analysis will use  the digital elevation model (dem) based on data from the mars orbiter laser altimeter (mola;  smith  et  al.,  2001).  next,  subtract  the  seasonal  diurnal  estimates  from  the  originally  gridded  observations. square these anomalies. then, fit the long-term mean and the seasonal cycle to these  values.   the   result   will   reveal   the   seasonal/diurnal   cycle   of   variance.   as   done   for   the  seasonal/diurnal     cycle     of     temperature,     develop     elevation/latitude/day-of-year/time-of- day/topography  models  for  surface  temperature  variance.  then,  extend  over  a  range  of  other  heights  through  the  sounding  database.  data  will  be  stored  at  the  newly  funded  atmospheric  modeling “annex,” at the new mexico state university planetary atmospheres node. the contact  there is lynn  neakrase  (lneakras@nmsu.edu).  he  will  house  the  resulting  data  (including  user- controllable animations and the actual digital arrays) for public access.     the  program  element for  the  project is  c.9,  mars  data  analysis.  all  proposed  tasks  are  data  analysis.  the  proposed  work  analyzed  temperature  profile  data  from  the  mars  reconnaissance  orbiter, which is listed in the call.  understanding the seasonal/diurnal cycles of temperature as  functions  of  latitude,  longitude,  and  height,  and  topography,  along  with  the  similar  cycles  of  temperature variance will provide a  range of expectation values of temperature  at each location  across the planet across its seasonal and diurnal fluctuations. none of the other roses programs  is congruent with the proposed work.

    "erin bell": "  project summary    we  propose  a  cohort  study  to  evaluate  the  immunological  impact  of  exposure  to  perfluoroalkyl  substances   (pfas). there is increasing evidence that pfas may exert subtle and sub-clinical changes on immune system  function,  resulting in  increased  susceptibility  to  infectious  diseases  and  immune-mediated  pathologies.  epidemiological evidence suggests associations between immune-related outcomes including the prevalence of  asthma and rhinitis as well as lower antibody (ab) response to vaccine antigens (ags)   with high serum  pfas   levels and mainly in children. examination of pfas influences in older adults is especially important, because  they may have longer longitudinal exposure to pfas and their immune systems may be declining due to aging.  susceptibility to pfas’ immunotoxicity is posited to be dependent on a person’s genetics, age, and exposome.  furthermore,  pfas  are  known  to  cause  dyslipidemia,  which  can  increase  inflammation  and  oxidative  stress   (os). the mechanistic interactions responsible for the association of pfas with pathologies and suppression of  ab production require delineation to validate causality.    we will enroll a cohort of 250 adult participants residing  in communities with documented pfas contamination of drinking water. we will measure and examine pfas  serum  concentrations  across  standard  demographic  characteristics  (e.g.  age)  and  medical  history  in  study  participants.    we  will  then  measure  and  examine  blood  leukocyte  subset  numbers  and  biochemistry  by   concentration  of  plasma  pfas  levels.  we  will  establish  in  vitro  background  proliferation  and  response  to   influenza (flu) vaccine of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) by pfas exposure distribution and  involvement  of  cellular  and  plasma  protein  thiols  (r-sh)  and  glutathione  (gsh).    we  will  follow  these  study   participants  forward  in  time  to  update.    we  will  administer  a  flu vaccine  and  examine  in  vivo  immunity  with   measurement  of  activated  memory  cd4 +   and  cd8 +   t  cells  and  cytokines  at  7  days  after  flu  vaccine  administration  and  anti-flu  antibodies  at  7  and  14  days;  evaluate  if  the  ex  vivo  and in  vitro  responses  are   comparable after flu vaccine and investigate if the pbmc are directly inhibited by pfas and/or are suppressed  by  plasma  constituents  generated  by  pfas  exposure.  finally,  we  will  determine  the  pfas  modifications  of   pbmc  and/or  plasma  constituents,  e.g.,  biochemical  parameters,  responsible  for  pfas  direct  modification  of   pbmc, generation of host factors in plasma that are immunosuppressive, or both of these immune modulations  with pbmc and plasma from study participant samples with low and high immune responsiveness.  our aims  are  addressed  by  a collaborative team of  epidemiologists,  immunologists  and  chemists  to  investigate   biochemical  and  molecular  effects  of  pfas  in  communities  with  pfas  exposure,  which  provide  cross- disciplinary interactions with project 3.     longitudinal investigation of drinking water pfas and changes in thyroid function, gonad function, and lipid profiles among residents of hoosick falls and newburgh, ny   project summary aims: we propose a cohort study to evaluate the impact of perfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) on hormones and lipids among residents of two new york state municipalities with drinking water pfas contamination, hoosick falls (pfoa) and newburgh (pfos and pfhxs). the focus will be on differences over time, in thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and lipids, measured in blood specimens shortly after and long after a drinking water intervention.  significance: despite widespread contamination of municipal drinking water supplies in the u.s. and elsewhere, few longitudinal data are available to assess the effects on hormones and lipids, and to evaluate the impact of a drinking water pfas intervention. while previous epidemiologic studies reported cross-sectional associations between blood pfas, hormones, and lipids, the results have been inconsistent and were frequently limited by potential reverse causation, exposure misclassification, confounding, and by low exposure contrasts. furthermore, very little work has been completed in diverse communities. the proposed study will address these limitations to advance understanding of how drinking water pfas contamination affects thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and lipids in adults and children over time, and the impact of a drinking water intervention on the associations in a diverse community. we will also explore the effects of co-exposure to a mixture of pfas. this study directly addresses critical gaps in our understanding the effects of pfas on human health. innovation: the proposed study will leverage: 1. archived biospecimens previously collected by the new york state department of health during 2016-2017 biomonitoring studies, which were conducted shortly after drinking a pfas drinking water intervention, these will be \"baseline\" specimens; and 2. biospecimen that will be collected from the same people in 2021-2022, as part of our ongoing cdc-funded pfas multi-site health study, these will be \"follow-up\" biospecimens. ours will be the first comprehensive u.s.-based study to investigate the longitudinal impact of a pfas drinking water intervention on hormones and lipids in adults and children, using biomarkers of exposure, in a diverse community with long-term municipal drinking water pfas contamination. approach: we will measure thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and lipids in 500 adults and 200 children who provided baseline blood specimens for pfas analysis in 2016-2017. we will estimate cross-sectional associations of pfas with hormones and lipids in 2016-2017, prospective associations of pfas measured at baseline in 2016-2017 with hormones and lipids measured at follow-up in 2021-2022, and longitudinal associations of differences in pfas measured at baseline in 2016-2017 and follow-up in 2021-2022, with hormones and lipids measured at baseline and follow-up. we will also explore the impact of co-exposure to a mixture of pfas. successful completion of our project is ensured by the experience of the team, who collaborate on the ongoing cdc-funded pfas multi-site health study, upon which this proposal is based.   specific aims municipal drinking water pfas contamination appears to be widespread in u.s. communities, a result of historic and ongoing industrial operations, manufacturing, and use of aqueous film-forming firefighting foams. understanding the health implications of chronic pfas exposure is thus a critical and growing health concern. although levels of some pfas have declined in the general u.s. population, following industry-wide phase outs of pfoa and pfos in the early 2000s, exposure remains an important health concern, given their extreme persistence in the environment, continued use, and ongoing manufacture elsewhere. the residents of communities with municipal drinking water pfas contamination are especially vulnerable. at high pfas doses used in experimental studies or found in the workplace, exposure has been associated with changes in endocrine function, including thyroid and sex hormones, and with a more atherogenic lipid profile. yet, the impacts of chronic pfas exposure remain unclear at the moderate doses typically associated with drinking water contamination incidents. most previous studies of such populations relied on cross-sectional designs or retrospective dose reconstruction, and have not included diverse communities, which have also been affected. previous studies were hampered by reverse causation, confounding, exposure misclassification, and limited generalizability. here, we address these data gaps with a longitudinal design that builds on our team's ongoing cdc-funded investigation of pfas and health in two communities with drinking water pfas contamination. pfas were detected in the municipal drinking water supplies of hoosick falls, ny (pfoa) in 2015, a small rural community, and newburgh, ny (pfos and pfhxs) in 2016, a large and diverse urban community; a result of industrial effluent and fire-fighting foam use, respectively. public health authorities intervened shortly after, providing alternate drinking water to each community and later filtration. the new york state department of health (nysdoh) also initiated biomonitoring studies of the affected populations. hoosick falls residents had serum pfoa (median=58.9 μg/l) nearly 37x greater than the 2015-2016 u.s. population and median serum pfos (20.1 μg/l) and pfhxs (12.7 μg/l) in newburgh were 4.2x and 10.6x greater than the 2016-2016 u.s. population, respectively. the biomonitoring data suggested ongoing pfas contamination for at least 40 years in hoosick falls and 20 years in newburgh. however, the biomonitoring data also suggested that serum pfoa (~33%) and pfos (~28%) decline within a few months of the intervention. to assess the impact of pfas drinking water contamination and the intervention on endocrine and lipid function, we will measure thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and lipids in residual blood sera that were previously collected from residents of hoosick falls and newburgh in 2016-2017. these will be the \"baseline\" specimens, collected shortly after the drinking water intervention. we will prospectively assess differences with repeat biospecimens that will be collected from the same individuals in 2021-2022, as part of our ongoing cdc-funded multi-site health study of pfas. these will be the \"follow up\" specimens, collected several years after the drinking water intervention. our long-term goal is to more clearly characterize the impact of drinking water pfas contamination and the intervention on thyroid function, gonad function, and lipid profiles in a diverse population of adults and children. to accomplish our long-term goal, we will:  estimate cross-sectional associations of baseline pfas with hormones and lipids in residual biospecimens. we will correlate previously measured pfoa, pfos, pfhxs, and pfna to thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and lipids, measured in residual biospecimens collected from adults (n=500) and children (n=200) in 2016-2017, to assess the contemporaneous effects of high dose pfas exposure. -we hypothesize that greater baseline pfas will correlate to lower thyroid hormones, sex hormones (children), igf-1 (children), and hdl, and to greater tsh, fsh and lh (children), total cholesterol, ldl, and triglycerides at baseline estimate prospective associations of baseline pfas with hormones and lipids measured at follow-up. we will correlate previously measured pfoa, pfos, pfhxs, and pfna in biospecimens in 2016-2017, to thyroid and sex hormones, and lipids, measured in biospecimens collected from adults (n=500) and children (n=200) at follow-up in 2021-2022, to assess the long-term effects of a high dose pfas exposure. -we hypothesize that greater baseline pfas will correlate to lower thyroid hormones, sex hormones (children), igf-1 (children), and hdl, and to greater tsh, fsh and lh (children), total cholesterol, ldl, and triglycerides at follow-up estimate longitudinal associations in pfas measured at baseline and follow-up with hormones and lipids measured at baseline and follow-up. we will correlate differences in pfoa, pfos, pfhxs, and pfna measured in baseline (2016-2017) and follow-up (2021-2022) biospecimens, with differences in thyroid and sex hormones, and lipids, measured at baseline and follow-up, from adults (n=500) and children (n=200), to estimate the impact of drinking water intervention after a high dose pfas exposure. -we hypothesize that pfas decreases from baseline to follow-up will correlate to increases in thyroid hormones, sex hormones and igf-1 (children), and hdl, and to decreases in tsh, fsh and lh (children), total cholesterol, ldl, and triglycerides from baseline to follow-up  our cost-effective strategy leverages archived biospecimens and builds upon our ongoing cdc-funded study of pfas and health outcomes. accomplishing these aims will provide much needed clarification of the impact of municipal drinking water pfas exposure on endocrine and lipid function in adults and children, the impact of drinking water remediation, and the effects in a diverse community. the study results will help policy makers, clinicians, and investigators to better manage the growing drinking water pfas contamination crisis.    abstract  the objective for our multi-site study, \"a health study of new york state communities exposed to pfas contaminated drinking water\", is to recruit a cohort from the greater hoosick falls and newburgh communities in new york state (nys). in hoosick falls, pfoa levels in the public drinking water supply system were measured at levels between 500 and 600 ng/l (ppt) in 2016. in newburgh, samples from the city public system showed pfos levels at approximately 140 ppt, pfhxs levels at approximately 70 ppt, and pfoa levels at approximately 25 ppt. we also propose additional research projects that are responsive to these communities, while serving to enhance the core protocol and inform future pfas related hypotheses generalizable to other communities and study sites across the u.s. our proposed projects are designed to enhance the pfas multi site study core protocol and inform future work by leveraging stored blood samples from recent pfas biomonitoring activities in these communities to prospectively measure pfas and related health endpoint changes over time and measuring metals in blood samples of core participants. these projects will be conducted collaboratively between the university at albany school of public health (uasph) and the nys department of health (nysdoh). the uasph was created in 1985 as a unique partnership with the nysdoh; this partnership provides a platform for conducting large, statewide, prospective cohort studies examining emerging issues, particularly among vulnerable populations. together, we have developed infrastructure for recruitment, tracking, and retention of our study populations. this existing infrastructure and established community relationships will be leveraged to recruit a study cohort to examine the health effects of exposure to pfas contaminated drinking water.

    "scott miller": "scott miller summary  in support of noaa's efforts to improve the physics suite in the unified forecast system (ufs) atmospheric model, we propose to build a prototype framework for evaluating ufs land surface models (lsms), land-atmosphere coupling, and planetary boundary layer (pbl) schemes, and to demonstrate the ufs performance at regional scale using data from the new york state mesonet (nysm), a dense ground-based observation network installed in 2017 that includes a broad range of land surface types (e.g., agriculture, mountain, valley, coastal, urban, suburban, forested, wetland). standard and advanced evaluation metric suites will be developed for ufs model evaluation, intercomparison, and verification. the standard suite will focus on developing use-cases for the model evaluation tools enhanced framework (metplus) and will include commonly-used quantities for timeseries analysis and forecast validation. the advanced evaluation metric suite will focus on information theory metrics including mutual information, transfer entropy, and conditional transfer entropy to provide new insights into coupled model behavior. this framework will be developed in a manner that can be expanded to other observation networks independent of spatiotemporal scales. developing the framework within metplus provides a model- and observation network-agnostic tool that can be readily applied to other observational networks (e.g., fluxnet or ameriflux) and to other models.   the output land-surface and near-surface atmospheric fields from fv3gfs parallel runs provided by ncep/emc will be evaluated using observations at the 126 nysm standard sites (meteorology, including soil moisture/temperature profiles), 20 \"snow sites\" with snow water equivalent, 17 \"profiler sites\" with 3d scanning lidar and microwave radiometers (wind, temperature, moisture profiles, pbl height), and 18 \"flux sites\" with eddy covariance (ec) momentum, heat, and moisture fluxes. the ec fluxes and associated quantities will be used to evaluate land surface states (e.g., soil moisture, soil temperature) and land-surface exchange (e.g., conductances, transfer coefficients, roughnesses, bowen ratio) from the ufs atmospheric model in near real-time (compared with year-or-more latency typical of ec flux data). these analyses will identify/quantify departures between observations and lsm output at a range of temporal (e.g., daily, synoptic, seasonal) and spatial scales ranging from point to flux tower footprints to multi-station regional averages, and across land surface cover, weather conditions, and climate regimes that will be provided to emc to guide efforts to improve model representations.    this ualbany-ncar-emc collaborative project directly responds to fy2021 jtti 1(b) programmatic priority by applying a hierarchical testing approach in the evaluation of ufs land models, with the corresponding development and application of land-atmosphere coupling metrics, and addresses fy2021 jtti 2(c) programmatic priority by introducing diagnostics for land-atmosphere interaction into the ufs metplus verification framework. the project is also relevant to obs-8 by harnessing a high-quality state mesonet and obs-9 through the use of the nysm to validate the ufs land model component.  the proposed work will not involve testing in one of the noaa testbeds or proving grounds, and no noaa computing resources are requested.    scott miller -

    "damian zuloaga": "project summary  postpartum depression and anxiety afflict approximately 900,000 women annually, producing devastating effects on both the mother and her developing child. unfortunately, the neurobiological and hormonal basis of these disorders are poorly understood. recent studies in our laboratory have revealed dynamic expression of corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 (crfr1) in the anteroventral periventricular hypothalamus (avpv), medial preoptic area (mpoa), and paraventricular hypothalamus in postpartum mice. in rodents, corticotropin releasing factor (crf) signaling through crfr1 is known to regulate anxiety and depressive-like behaviors as well as stress hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), glucocorticoid)) secretion, although the specific function of avpv, mpoa, and pvn crfr1 cell groups in regulating stress functions during the postpartum period is currently unknown.   in the first aim, we will determine the role of avpv, mpoa, and pvn crfr1 cells in regulating stress-associated behaviors and neuroendocrine responses during the postpartum period. this will be assessed by utilizing transgenic mouse lines and stereotaxic injections of aavs to delete or overexpress crfr1. stress-related behaviors and acth/glucocorticoid responses to psychological stress will be assessed in these mice. importantly, this aim will reveal a unique populations of crfr1 cells that is critical to regulating postpartum stress-associated functions. our preliminary findings indicate that changes in crfr1 within the avpv, mpoa, and pvn are mimicked by treating virgin mice with pregnancy/postpartum period relevant levels of estradiol and progesterone. we further demonstrate that crfr1 neurons in all 3 regions highly co-express a key receptor for estrogen (estrogen receptor alpha (erα)). we therefore hypothesize that estrogen signaling through erα regulates changes in crfr1 as well alterations in stress-associated functions during the postpartum period. to test this (aim 2), we will utilize a line of mice in which erα has been deleted from crfr1 neurons and assess effects on anxiety/depressive-like behaviors as well as stress hormone release both during the postpartum period and after exposure to treatments with estradiol/progesterone that are designed to mimic naturally occurring changes in these hormones. in the final aim (3) we will assess postpartum changes in functional connectivity of crfr1 avpv, mpoa, and pvn cells with other stress-regulating brain sites. this study will utilize cutting edge tract tracing tools to assess upstream and downstream projection sites of crfr1 neurons that are engaged during psychological stress. altogether, this aim will reveal specific circuits that are modified during the postpartum period and therefore may regulate postpartum stress responses. overall, we expect these studies will identify critical cell groups and circuitry that regulate postpartum stress-related behaviors, thus aiding in our understanding of the neurobiological roots of related human disorders, including postpartum depression and anxiety.    project summary  postpartum depression and anxiety

abstract  both oxytocin (ot) and corticotropin releasing factor (crf) have been proposed to play key roles in the mediating effects of stress on maternal behaviors, although the neural mechanisms that underlie this remains largely unknown. of particular interest is how these two systems might interact to regulate maternal functions.  dr. nicholas justice's laboratory recently discovered that a substantial percentage of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (pvn) begin to express the primary receptor for corticotropin releasing factor (crf), crfr1, during the postpartum period, whereas virgin mice do not express this dual-phenotype. crfr1 and oxytocin are widely known to regulate stress-related behaviors, therefore this represents a potential key cell group for mediating effects of stress on maternal behaviors. we hypothesize that the appearance of crfr1 within ot neurons of postpartum mice induces a dynamic shift in crf function, whereby signaling to ot neurons buffers the stress response to facilitate maternal care under conditions of stress. in this series of experiments we propose to chart the dynamic changes in crfr1/ot+ neurons across single and multiple breeding cycles, then determine the consequences of this phenomenon on ot release and maternal behaviors. my laboratory (zuloaga) will be involved in experiments assessing maternal behaviors and will perform hormone measurements.    abstract women constitute two-thirds of all people with alzheimer's disease (ad) and show more rapid cognitive decline and greater rates of depression compared to men with ad1. associated with ad onset is a sex/age-related decline in gonadal hormones (estrogen/testosterone) which likely contributes to these sex

15-17. therefore, the loss of ar and erβ binding, due to decreases in estrogen and testosterone that occur in aging, might exacerbate ad pathology and cognitive decline by dysregulating the hpa axis and elevating gcs.   in the proposed study we will utilize a mouse model of ad (3xtg-ad) to assess the role of these two gonadal hormone receptors (ar and erβ) in the development of hpa axis dysfunction, ad pathology, cognitive decline, and anxiety/depressive-like behaviors. mice will also be tested after chronic stress or no stress and in the presence or absence of a glucocorticoid receptor (gr) antagonist to determine whether protective effects of ar and erβ are mediated by reducing gc actions through gr. this is of clinical importance because chronic stress is a known risk factor for ad and leads to breakdown in hpa axis function and elevated gc releasepevuze5vdgu+penpdgu+pef1dghvcj5xawxzb248l0f1dghvcj48wwvhcj4ymda1pc9zzwfypjxs

of the hpa axis, decrease anxiety/depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline and reduce ad pathology. we further predict ar and erβ agonists will have greater protective effects in the context of chronic stress, due to their ability to decrease gc release and subsequent binding of gr. in the below aims we propose to test ar effects in males and erβ effects in females due to their greater potential for treatment efficacy within that sex.   in aim 1 we will determine the role of ar modulation of the hpa axis in mediating effects on ad pathology, affective behaviors, and cognitive decline. male 3xtg-ad mice will be gonadectomized and administered pellets containing an agonist of ar (dihydrotestosterone (dht)), or empty capsules (control). all mice will also be co-administered pellets containing the gr antagonist mifepristone or a blank pellet and subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress, or no stress, to determine the role of gcs in mediating effects of ar. ad pathology (aβ, tau), cognitive functions (learning and memory), and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors will also be assessed. effects on hpa axis function will also be assessed measuring gcs, hpa axis proteins, and neural activation patterns of neurons in brain regions associated with hpa axis regulation (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala, cortex). in aim 2 we will determine the role of erβ modulation of the hpa axis in mediating effects on ad pathology, affective behaviors, and cognitive decline. female 3xtg-ad mice will be gonadectomized and implanted with pellets containing an erβ agonist diarylpropionitrile (dpn), a gr antagonist, or control pellets. mice will then be subjected to chronic stress to determine interactions between erβ and gcs in regulating ad outcome. ad pathology, cognitive and anxiety/depressive-like behaviors, and hpa axis function will be assayed. we expect these experiments will uncover a key mechanism through which sex hormones and stress hormones interact to influence ad outcome. overall, these studies have implications for developing sex-specific treatments for combating ad, particularly in the context of stress.   project summary  there are striking sex differences in stress/mood associated disorders, such as anxiety and depression with women showing 2-3 fold greater prevalence than men. these differences are postulated to be regulated by sex-specific patterns of gonadal hormone exposure and their subsequent effects on brain circuitry. in particular, androgen actions through the cognate androgen receptor (ar) have been shown by our lab and others to suppress the release of stress hormones and decrease anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. however, the specific neural mechanisms (cell types and brain regions) through which androgens act to produce these effects remains largely unknown. recent studies in our laboratory demonstrate the presence of ar within key stress-regulating cell types ((corticotropin releasing factor (crf) and crf receptor 1 (crfr1) expressing cells)). crf signaling through crfr1 is widely known to regulate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as well as stress hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucocorticoid) secretion, although how androgens might interact with the crf/crfr1 system to regulate these functions is currently unknown. furthermore, the specific brain regions upon which androgens act to modulate stress-related functions is also largely unclear, although preliminary work indicates the paraventricular hypothalamus (pvn) and ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bstv) may be critical.   in the first aim, we will utilize transgenic mouse lines with selective deletion or overexpression of ar in crf or crfr1 neurons to test the hypothesis that these are the critical cell types upon which androgens act to regulate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and stress hormone release. we expect these experiments will reveal the elusive cell phenotype(s) that regulate androgens effects on stress functions. we will then utilize a combination of viral vectors and transgenic mouse lines to test the hypothesis that the pvn (aim 2a) and bstv (aim 3a) are the key brain sites upon which androgens bind ar to modulate anxiety-like behaviors, depressive-like behaviors, and stress hormone release. prior work, including our own, indicates that these brain regions express high levels of ar and may be critical sites for androgen→ar regulation of stress-related functions. in we will also explore the role of ar, specifically within crf and crfr1 neurons of the pvn (aim 2b) and bstv (aim 3b), in regulating stress-associated behaviors and the hpa axis. this will be accomplished using viruses designed to knockdown or overexpress ar within cre-expressing neurons. overall, we expect these studies will identify critical cell groups that regulate stress-related functions, thus aiding in our understanding of the neurobiological roots of related human disorders, including depression and anxiety.          abstract  both oxytocin (ot) and corticotropin releasing factor (crf) have been proposed to play key roles in the mediating effects of stress on maternal behaviors, although the neural mechanisms that underlie this remains largely unknown. of particular interest is how these two systems might interact to regulate maternal functions.  dr. nicholas justice's laboratory recently discovered that a substantial percentage of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (pvn) begin to express the primary receptor for corticotropin releasing factor (crf), crfr1, during the postpartum period, whereas virgin mice do not express this dual-phenotype. crfr1 and oxytocin are widely known to regulate stress-related behaviors, therefore this represents a potential key cell group for mediating effects of stress on maternal behaviors. we hypothesize that the appearance of crfr1 within ot neurons of postpartum mice induces a dynamic shift in crf function, whereby signaling to ot neurons buffers the stress response to facilitate maternal care under conditions of stress. in this series of experiments we propose to chart the dynamic changes in crfr1/ot+ neurons across single and multiple breeding cycles, then determine the consequences of this phenomenon on ot release and maternal behaviors. my laboratory (zuloaga) will be involved in experiments assessing maternal behaviors and will perform hormone measurements.    project abstract age related declines in sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) onset and cognitive decline. psychological stress and the accompanying increase in stress hormones (glucocorticoids) is also linked with a more rapid ad progression and worse outcome. in the current proposal we aim to investigate how sex and stress hormones interact to influence ad outcome. specifically, we will focus on two specific receptor subtypes [androgen receptor (ar) and estrogen receptor beta (erβ)] that have been shown to have protective effects in the context of ad; reducing cognitive impairments and pathology. binding to both ar and erβ are also known to play a critical role in limiting the release of stress-induced glucocorticoids and maintaining normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, which ultimately controls glucocorticoid secretion. we hypothesize that the loss of binding to ar and erβ, due to a decline in sex hormones with aging, dysregulates the hpa axis. this, in turn, worsens ad pathology which drives a decline in cognitive function and increases stress-related behaviors that are commonly co-morbid with ad. specifically, we will determine the role of ar (aim 1) and erβ (aim 2) in mediating effects of chronic stress and endocrine aging on ad pathology, stress-related behaviors, and cognitive decline. we will test ar effects in males and erβ effects in females due to their greater potential for treatment efficacy within that sex. for both aims we will utilize a knock-in mouse model of ad (appnl-f). male appnl-f mice will be gonadectomized (to model sex hormone deficiency in aging) and administered an agonist of ar or empty capsules (controls) (aim 1). female appnl-f mice will either be gonadectomized, or subjected to an accelerated ovarian failure menopause paradigm, and treated with an agonist of erβ or empty capsules (aim 2). to assess the interactions of sex hormone receptors and stress, mice will be subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (or no stress). mice will then be assessed for cognitive function, stress-related behaviors, hpa axis function, and ad pathology. we predict that treatment of mice with ar and erβ agonists will suppress breakdown of hpa axis, and reduce ad pathology, anxiety/depressive-like behaviors, and cognitive decline. we further expect ar and erβ agonists will have enhanced protective effects in the context of chronic stress, due to their ability to decrease glucocorticoid release. overall, these studies will fill a critical gap in our understanding of how sex and stress hormones interact to influence ad outcome and will therefore aid in the development of sex-specific treatments to combat ad.

    "maksim royzen": "  a. specific aims  tumor-specific delivery  of anticancer drugs remains to  be  a  major biomedical  challenge. to  address  this  challenge, we  developed  a  bio-orthogonal  chemistry-based  approach  for  local  activation  of  systemically  administered prodrugs. the key element of our design, illustrated in the scheme is biomaterial, modified with  tetrazine (tz),  injected near  a cancerous  tumor (step  1).  a prodrug  with  attenuated  activity  containing  a  releasable trans-cyclooctene (tco) moiety is injected intravenously and travels through the circulatory system  (step 2). when the prodrug and the biomaterial come in contact, the bio-orthogonal groups, tz and tco, react  with each other. the capture step (3) concentrates the prodrug in the location of the body requiring treatment.  finally, the resulting intermediate isomerizes spontaneously releasing the active drug from the biomaterial to  perform its therapeutic function locally (step 4). the multivalency of the biomaterial allows for the process to be  repeated multiple times with different prodrugs, enabling synergistic combinations of different anticancer agents.        statement of potential impact  the preliminary data, involving a prodrug of doxorubicin, illustrated two transformative aspects of tumor-specific  drug delivery. unlike the antibody-drug conjugates (adcs), our technology does not rely on any endogenous  molecular  markers  or  metabolic  activity. in contrast  to the standard  materials-based approaches involving  implantation or intratumoral injection of biomaterials with spontaneously releasing chemotherapeutic agents, the  local drug activation system can be reloaded, thus allowing temporal modulation of multiple dosages and multi- drug regiments. the general approach could be optimized for treatment of different local cancers using different  chemotherapeutic prodrugs. the  goal  of  this medicinal  chemistry proposal  is  to broaden  and  improve  the  platform by developing a more effective biomaterial, as well as prodrugs of paclitaxel, etoposide and gemcitabine  with improved solubility, plasma stability and in situ activation.    the specific aims of the proposed research are:  aim 1. synthesis of prodrugs of paclitaxel, etoposide and gemcitabine and evaluation of their in vitro  properties. during  preliminary studies we carried  out  pre-clinical  development  of  a  tz-modified  biomaterial  capable of local activation of systemically administered prodrug of doxorubicin. extensive in vitro and in vivo  studies have led to fda’s approval of the first-in-human clinical trials which began in 2020. our goal is to broaden  the platform to include other important chemotherapeutic drugs - paclitaxel, etoposide and gemcitabine. guided  by the design principles developed during preliminary work, we will synthesize the prodrugs and evaluate their  in vitro cytotoxicity, solubility, blood plasma stability and activation by tz-modified biomaterial.  aim 2. synthesis of dimeric prodrugs.   different combinations of dimeric prodrugs capable of activating two units of cytotoxic agents upon a single  ‘catch’ step will be synthesized. kinetics of prodrug activation will be studied in vitro using hplc. cytotoxicity,  solubility and blood plasma stability will also be evaluated.  aim 3: development of biomaterials with improved prodrug activation efficiency.  to improve the efficiency of prodrug activation, a library of tetrazines will be synthesized and coupled to the  biomaterial. activation of the prodrugs developed in aims 1 and 2 will be tested in vitro using hplc. in vivo  bioconjugation studies will be carried out using new biomaterials and a chemiluminescent probe to determine  the efficiency of in vivo ‘catch and release’ chemistry.    schematic design of ‘catch and release’ system for local drug activation.    1 systemic infusion of  sqp33 prodrug infusion

severely limited and ultimately rely on palliative care representing an unmet clinical need. previous studies have demonstrated that micrornas play a significant role in the formation of metastasis including those from breast cancer. considering the paucity of options for patients with metastasis from breast cancer, in this proposal we focused on targeting mir-10b proven to be responsible for metastatic spread. while previous studies showed that mir-10b drives invasion and migration of cancer cells from primary tumors, our recent discovery demonstrated that in metastatic cells it is also responsible for cell viability and proliferation and that survival of metastatic cells crucially depends on the high level of mir-10b expression. this discovery formed a cornerstone of our therapeutic strategy aimed at specific eradication of metastatic tumor cells. this will be done using imaging-capable modular nanodrugs, which distribute to lung, liver, bone, or brain metastases. these nanodrugs consist of magnetic nanoparticles that carry locked-nucleic acid (lna) oligonucleotides inhibiting microrna-10b. when treatment with the nanodrug was combined with a low-dose of conventional chemotherapy (doxorubicin), there was regression and permanent elimination of lymph node or lung metastases without relapse.  the competitive revision will address the issues encountered in the original r01 project, namely dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin and reduced nanodrug stability in serum. these shortcomings will be addressed using the technology developed during the imat project. the technology is based on the bio-orthogonal chemistry between tetrazine and trans-cyclooctene (tco) and allows concentration and activation of anticancer prodrugs at a location of the body of interest. in this revision application, we propose to redesign both mn-anti-mir10b and doxorubicin in order to enhance stability and tumor-specific delivery. the modified system will enhance therapeutic efficacy by trapping and releasing the prodrugs specifically within the tumor microenvironment. systemic toxicity will be minimized by rendering the prodrugs inactive until they reach the tumor. lastly, a disulfide linkage between the nanoparticles and the antagomir will be replaced with a releasable tco rendering the nanodrug more stable and increasing the effective local concentration of intact nanodrug in the tumor.   title: improved biomaterials for in vivo drug release using the local capture and activation therapy (lcat) platform.  project summary:    the goal of this proposal is to establish a new transformative paradigm for local tumor control, independent of molecular markers or metabolic activity, that allows tailored multi-drug dosing regimens. the project addresses the increasing need of developing new treatments of pediatric sarcomas. the five-year survival rates of patients with this ailment are at 67% and have not improved since the 1990's. there have been no major therapeutic improvements for the remaining third of patients in over 25 years. meanwhile, only 25% of 120 new cancer drugs approved by the fda between 1948 and 2002 are used in children. the proposed materials-based strategy termed 'catch and release' is based on bio-orthogonal inverse-electron demand diels-alder (iedda) reaction between tetrazine and trans-cyclooctene (tco). the key element of the proposed design is biocompatible hydrogel, modified with tetrazine (hmt), injected in the vicinity of a local sarcoma tumor. pro-drugs with attenuated activity and minimal side effects, containing a releasable tco moiety will be systemically injected. when the pro-drug and the hydrogel come in contact, the bio-orthogonal agents react with each other through iedda reaction 'catching' the payload. finally, the resulting intermediate isomerizes spontaneously releasing the active cytotoxic compound from the hydrogel to perform its therapeutic function locally. preliminary in vitro data have shown that hmt is stable under simulated physiological conditions and capable of converting multiple doses of pro-drug of doxorubicin into the active anticancer drug. meanwhile, preliminary in vivo testing proved that the 'catch and release' strategy is capable of local activation of therapeutically meaningful quantities of doxorubicin to treat sarcoma. multivalency of hmt allows for the process to be repeated with multiple doses of the systemically administered pro-drugs.   abstract  the crispr-cas9 system is a powerful genome editing tool that profoundly revolutionized biomedical research and holds enormous potential for successful treatment of human genetic diseases. the two-component system, consisting of a single-guide rna (sgrna) and a dna nuclease, cas9, form a complex capable of targeting double stranded dna with a nucleotide precision. this technology has been successfully applied for genome editing on the cellular level, as well as in vivo. in recent years, crispr technology has been evaluated in several human clinical trials for the treatment of blood disorders, various cancers, eye disease and chronic infection. virtually all fda-approved rna-based therapeutics contain rna modifications. clinical success of crispr technology is likely dependent on calculated incorporation of rna modifications which can potentially improve sgrna stability, on-target efficiency and lower off-target effects. a number of rna modifications have already been explored to achieve these goals. none of the reported systems however examined sgrna containing nucleobase modifications, which are common in nature and capable of regulating critical cellular processes. this is likely due to the fact that sgrna is over 100-nt long and solid phase synthesis (sps) of long oligonucleotides is difficult. furthermore, incorporation of nucleobase-modified rna phosphoramidites during sps exacerbates the problem, as it is typically associated with lower coupling yields. the goal of this grant is to develop a versatile synthetic approach that will allow to examine effects of n1-methyladenosine (m1a), n6-methyladenosine m6a, 2-thiouridine (s2u) and 4-thiouridine (s4u) modifications on crispr activity.

    "jia sheng": "abstract cells respond to environmental stresses by regulating gene expression. recent studies have demonstrated that stress promotes changes in the levels of enzyme-modified nucleosides found in the anticodon of many trnas, to regulate the translation of stress-response transcripts with specific codon usage patterns.  in bacteria the wobble u34 residue of trna can be modified by thiolation, geranylation or selenation at position 2, as well as distinct modifications to position 5, to produce 12 distinct modified uridines, with many predicted to play key roles in translation and stress responses. the mnm cluster enzymes can catalyze the formation of these modified uridines and due to their uniqueness to bacteria and the importance of corresponding wobble uridines in the stress response, we propose that they can be exploited for new antibiotics development. we have used chemical biology and structural studies to demonstrate that 2-thiouridine (s2u), geranyl-2-thiouridine (ges2u) and seleno-2-thiouridine (se2u) have different base pairing specificity. in addition, using codon analytics of all e. coli genes, we have identified codon-biased transcripts that could be translationally regulated by s2u, ges2u and se2u modifications. we have also shown that cells deficient in the wobble u modifying enzymes mnme and mnmh are sensitive to killing by chloramphenicol (cam) and have perturbed translation. we hypothesize that s2u, ges2u and se2u modification levels change in response to environmental stress, to regulate the translation of

tag and visualize thiolated trnas and small ligand inhibitors, which will be tested for their potential new antibiotics. the proposed studies are significant, as they will define a new form of translational regulation in bacteria, generate new reagents and technologies for tagging epitranscriptomic marks and could provide a path to a new class of antibiotics that target rna modification enzymes.   abstract:  pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) is an environmentally ubiquitous, non-fermenting gram-negative bacterium that colonizes different terrestrial and aquatic niches. pa often infects immunocompromised individuals with hiv infection, cancer, cystic fibrosis (cf), and surgical or burn wounds. pa can also cause serious infections in the corneas of patients with extended use of contact lenses and in the urinary tract using catheterization. pa accounts for 10.1% of nosocomial infections, making it a highly significant bacterium in hospital settings. owing to pa's ubiquitous nature and extremely complex genomic diversity, one third of pa clinical isolates are resistant to three or more antibiotics, including third generation cephalosporins and imipenem that are the gold standard antibiotics for pa infection. increased prevalence of pa infections in hospital settings confers an urgent need for pa vaccines for these susceptible populations. currently, no licensed pa vaccines are available for human use.  the world's first mrna vaccine has begun its rollout after being produced at unprecedented speed as part of the global effort to end the covid-19 pandemic. current covid-19 vaccines were well tolerant and mounted robust immune responses in both immunocompetence and immunocompromised individuals. the mrna vaccines combine desirable immunological properties with an outstanding safety profile and the unmet flexibility of genetic vaccines. based on in situ protein expression in vivo, mrna vaccines can induce a balanced immune response comprising both humoral and cellular immunity while not subject to mhc haplotype restriction. also, mrna is an intrinsically safe vector as it is a minimal and only transient carrier of information that does not interact with the genome. therefore, mrna presents a promising vector that may well become the basis of a game-changing vaccine technology platform. in this application, we propose to leverage the knowledge and techniques we have established in rna synthesis and modification to develop new mrna vaccine encoding pa antigens. the successful pa rna vaccine will be able to protect persons who have a weak immune system and certain underlying diseases and be extensible to other bacterial pathogens.    abstract  cells  respond  to  environmental  stresses  by  regulating  gene  expression.  recent

drug delivery systems with controllable drug loading and triggered release could be transformative for cancer  treatment.  controlled  drug  delivery  reduces  the  required  drug  dosage  and  increases  bioavailability of  drug.   further, creating drug delivery systems that can respond to external stimuli and release the drug are valuable in  treating  tumor  regions  without  the  exposing  healthy  tissue  to  high  doses  of  drug.  this  reduced  dosage  by  controllable attachment and triggered release within the therapeutic window at the target site has the potential  to  dramatically  reduce  the  often severe  side  effects  of  chemotherapy.  organic  and  inorganic  drug  delivery   systems  developed  for  this  purpose  lack  size  homogeneity,  quantifiable  drug  attachment  and  release  by   harmless stimuli. the emerging field of dna nanotechnology has the potential to solve some of these issues,  offering controllable size and inherent biocompatibility.     we propose a new approach combining synthetic chemistry and dna nanotechnology to overcome these issues.  synthetic chemistry techniques provide mechanisms for attaching chemotherapeutic drugs, triggering release  by  light,  and  protecting  against  biological  degradation.  dna  nanotechnology  offers  near-atomic  control  over   building shapes and structures, eliminating heterogeneity in size of drug carriers. dna can be functionalized with  additional chemical groups that allow controllable attachment of drug molecules with triggered release capability.  since  dna  is  a  biological  material,  dna  nanostructures  elicit  minimal  immune  response  when  used  in  drug   delivery,  are  non-toxic,  biocompatible  and  biodegradable.  our  approach  will  use  dna  tetrahedra  as  a  model   system and attach anti-skin cancer drugs cobimetinib and dabrafenib via click chemistry. for triggered release,  we  will  synthesize  a  near  infrared  (nir)  linker  and  incorporate  it  into  dna  strands.  specifically,  we  will:  (1)  develop  dna  tetrahedra  with  controllable  attachment  and  light-triggered  release  of  anticancer  drugs,  and  (2)  establish viability of dna nanostructure-based drug delivery in biological and cellular samples.    our proposal brings together a diverse group of researchers in chemistry, nanotechnology and cancer biology  to  provide  a  novel  approach  for  controllable  drug  delivery  vehicles.  the  proposed  strategy  has  a  number  of   advantages  including  (i)  precise  drug  loading  and  quantification,  (ii)  targeted  delivery  to  tumor  cells,  (iii)  biocompatibility  and  biodegradability,  (iv)  activated  release  by  a  harmless  remote  trigger  based  on  nir   irradiation,  and  (v)  enhanced  biostability  to  withstand  physiological  conditions  and  complex  biofluids.  we  anticipate that our approach will provide a robust proof of concept for viable chemotherapeutic drug delivery by  dna nanostructures with great future potential for clinical treatment of cancers.

    "rabi musah": "project summary-atmospheric fate of plant-derived volatile organosulfur compounds (vosc's): the goals of this project are to pursue: (1) computational investigations of the reaction mechanisms, energetics, and kinetics of terrestrial plant-derived vosc's with the atmospherically relevant free radicals ·oh, ·cl and o2; (2) estimation of the atmospheric life time of vosc's from both theoretical and experimental rate constants, and estimation of their global warming potentials (gwps); and (3) experimental measurement of the reaction kinetics of vosc's with oh and cl radicals using the relative rate technique. the work will be accomplished using high-level theoretical calculations and experimental work involving studies of reactions of environmentally relevant free radicals with the thiosulfinate series of natural vocs's, and related compounds.   1. intellectual merit a critical challenge in atmospheric chemistry research is the accurate determination of the atmospheric sulfur burden. while various models have been made to develop a global sulfur cycle, all of them underestimate the significant quantities of biogenic sulfur required to balance the sulfur cycle. our knowledge on biogenic sulfur emissions from the oceans has been improved significantly and we now have a reasonably clear picture of the amounts and types of sulfur emissions from the oceans, as well as their atmospheric fate. in contrast, information regarding terrestrial biogenic sulfur emission sources seems to represent the largest uncertainty in the atmospheric global sulfur budget. specifically, volatile organosulfur compounds (vosc's) released from living vascular plants, and their removal from the atmosphere, are not well known or understood. investigations of this chemistry have been hampered by:  (a) lack of information of the diversity of the sulfur species emitted; and (b) the experimental challenges associated with making kinetics measurements on a broad range of vosc's that are characteristically highly labile and difficult to handle, with environmentally relevant free radicals. the proposed work will utilize both theoretical and experimental approaches to determine the atmospheric fate of various plant-derived vosc's.   2. broader impacts these studies will contribute to an increased understanding of the global sulfur cycle by revealing the products formed when plant-derived vocss are intercepted by environmentally relevant free radicals, so that their fate in the atmosphere can then be assessed and their presence can be better monitored and understood. the results will also infer the extent to which these compounds may contribute to the atmospheric sulfur burden, and impact air pollution, global warming, acid rain, and cloud formation, among other phenomena. the information gleaned about the atmospheric lifetimes of the plant emissions themselves, will suggest their mixing and transport properties, and global warming potential. information will also be revealed about whether the cultivation of agricultural cash crops that generate the vosc's that are the subject of this proposal (such as garlic, onions, shallots, chives and other alliums), and which occupy millions of acres worldwide, have the potential to affect climate by creating organosulfur \"hotspots\" that contribute to climate phenomena through the emission of organosulfur compounds which when intercepted by free radicals, also generate greenhouse gases. the discovery of the products of these reactions will inform future systematic studies aimed at quantifying the emission rates of such compounds from farms. this project will also provide research and educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as a postdoctoral trainee, and expand the departmental infrastructure by providing improved hardware for experimental investigations of gas phase free radical reactions.   abstract as cited in the national institute of justice (nij) 2019 report to congress: needs assessment of forensic laboratories and medical examiner/coroner offices, some of the greatest challenges that have emerged in recent years are consequences of the \"legalization and decriminalization of marijuana and the permitted production of hemp.\" \"hemp\" and \"marijuana\" are the common names of two variants of the same species, cannabis sativa. their genetic relatedness makes them difficult to readily differentiate using the criteria that have be defined by the u.s. federal government. federal law defines c. sativa that contains >0.3% thc as marijuana, while that which contains <0.3% thc is hemp. these categorizations have imposed severe challenges on crime labs, including a dramatic increase in workload brought on by the need to perform quantitation on essentially all seized c. sativa samples.  it is proposed here that marijuana and hemp can be more easily and accurately differentiated by exploiting differences in their metabolome profiles that are reflections of the distinctions in their genetic makeup, and that this information can be readily and rapidly acquired by exploiting the unique capabilities of direct analysis in real time-high resolution mass spectrometry (dart-hrms). this hypothesis will be investigated through pursuit of the following four specific aims: (1) obtain and analyze a range of hemp and marijuana samples by dart-ms; (2) use advanced statistical analysis tools to investigate hemp and marijuana dart-ms-derived chemical profiles to reveal shared and distinguishing trends and masses; (3) identify and isolate compounds unique to marijuana and/or hemp; and (4) develop a database to distinguish hemp and marijuana, as well as differentiate between cultivars. these investigations will result in the development of rapid and cost-effective techniques for the detection and accurate identification of marijuana and hemp plant materials submitted to forensic laboratories as evidence. thus, the success of this project will provide tools for the rapid and efficient differentiation of marijuana and hemp, and result in development of a database that can be used by practitioners to distinguish between these varieties and their assorted cultivars.   title: development of a machine learning prediction model for the detection of ménière's disease from cerumen chemical profiles   background and rationale: ménière's disease is a chronic, incurable vestibular disorder that produces a recurring set of symptoms as a result of abnormally large amounts of endolymph in the inner ear. manifestations of the disease include recurrent episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, imbalance, nausea and/or vomiting, a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear, and fluctuating, progressive low-frequency hearing loss. diagnosis is difficult because other neurological conditions present some of the same symptoms. thus, ménière's disease diagnosis, which is challenging, imprecise, and time consuming, involves the painstaking process of excluding other diseases with overlapping symptoms. because it has no known chemical or radiographic markers, diagnosis is based on the observation of a clinical compendium of symptoms, and misdiagnosis is fairly common. if chemical markers of ménière's and other relevant neurological disorders could be determined, more rapid and accurate diagnosis could be achieved based on assessment of the presence (or absence) of these relevant compounds.  hypothesis: it is hypothesized here that the chemical profile of earwax can serve as a reporter of the presence of ménière's disease and other neurological disorders with overlapping symptoms, and that knowledge of these differential profiles can be leveraged to accurately and rapidly reveal the presence of ménière's disease. thus, the ultimate goal of the proposed work is to determine the biomarkers of ménière's disease as distinguished from those of other neurological disorders based on the analysis of earwax. this hypothesis will be investigated through pursuit of the following specific aims:  specific aim i: collection and determination of the mass spectral chemical signatures of cerumen from \"normal\", ménière's disease and patients diagnosed with other neurological disorders.  specific aim ii: development of machine learning prediction models that enable accurate determination of the presence of ménière's disease and/or other neurological disorders, and reveal the presence of a subset of compounds that are important for the ability to distinguish ménière's disease samples from others. specific aim iii: structural characterization of compounds revealed by the machine learning prediction model(s) developed in specific aim ii, to be associated with ménière's disease.  the results of this work will reveal whether there is a correlation between the lipid profile of earwax and the presence of particular disease states. using the earwax matrix, correlations between ménière's disease and other neurological disorder profiles will be discovered. structural information will be acquired on the molecules that are responsible for the differences in healthy and diseased persons. the successful accomplishment of this project would provide the opportunity for development of a potential non-invasive method for the diagnosis of ménière's disease and other neurological disorders based on simple analysis of earwax. the results from this project would lay the groundwork for the development of in-office test kits that can be readily utilized by clinicians for disease diagnosis. furthermore, the results have the potential to expand our understanding of the possible molecular basis of ménière's disease.  executive summary-750 characters including spaces:  the university at albany is committed to creating an inclusive, equitable, just, caring, and reaffirming campus culture that empowers all students, and in particular, people of color, to excel in their chosen pursuits. consequently, we are enacting self-study-informed changes within 1) stem units;

and (4) develop a database to distinguish hemp and marijuana, as well as differentiate between cultivars. these investigations will result in the development of rapid and cost-effective techniques for the detection and accurate identification of marijuana and hemp plant materials submitted to forensic laboratories as evidence. thus, the success of this project will provide tools for the rapid and efficient differentiation of marijuana and hemp, and result in development of a database that can be used by practitioners to distinguish between these varieties and their assorted cultivars.   title: research and development using high-level quantum chemistry calculations for the creation of a rapid field test for the identification and differentiation of hemp and marijuana   abstract as cited in the national institute of justice (nij) 2019 report to congress: needs assessment of forensic laboratories and medical examiner/coroner offices, some of the greatest challenges that have emerged in recent years are consequences of the \"legalization and decriminalization of marijuana and the permitted production of hemp.\" \"hemp\" and \"marijuana\" are the common names of two variants of the same species, cannabis sativa. their genetic relatedness makes them difficult to readily differentiate using the criteria that have be defined by the u.s. federal government. federal law defines c. sativa that contains >0.3% thc as marijuana, while that which contains <0.3% thc is hemp. these categorizations have imposed severe challenges on crime labs, including a dramatic increase in workload brought on by the need to perform quantitation on essentially all seized c. sativa samples. however, over and above this, there are no presumptive field tests available that can be used to make preliminary assessments of the identity of samples encountered in the field. this circumstance dramatically enhances the workload for crime labs because all suspicious samples must be submitted. it would be extremely useful to have test kits or field deployable devices that can be used to determine whether or not a given material is marijuana (in which it should be seized) verses hemp, in which case it should not be seized. the work proposed here seeks to develop field deployable kits that can be rapidly used to ascertain whether plant-based samples that are encountered in by forensic investigators are marijuana or hemp, through the use of high-level quantum chemical calculations which will inform the development of uv-vis and fluorescence-based assessment in combination with transition metal chemistry. these investigations will result in the development of rapid and cost-effective techniques for the detection and accurate identification of marijuana and hemp plant materials submitted to forensic laboratories as evidence.    discovery of species-specific mass spectral identifiers of wood rabi ann musah, state university of new york at albany, albany, ny 12222, usa  conventional approaches for the forensic identification (id) of plant materials such as endangered woods include dna profiling, morphological feature characterization and stable isotope analysis. although these methods permit varying levels of species differentiation, challenges remain. these include the fact that: (1) genotyping studies for the vast majority of plant species have not been performed, thereby making dna profiling impossible; and (2) there is a dearth of expertise in plant/wood anatomy-based id approaches. furthermore, current plant id methods are time consuming, not generally amenable to scale-up, and often do not permit species-level (as opposed to genus-level) identification. all of these factors contribute to the difficulty of addressing illegal logging and trade in endangered species. by exploiting the unique capabilities of direct analysis in real time-high resolution mass spectrometry (dart-hrms), we demonstrate that plant species are defined by highly specific chemical signatures that can be rapidly determined within a few seconds. furthermore, the coupling of these dart-hrms-generated chemical fingerprints with multivariate statistical analysis processing tools, enables species-level differentiation and identification. this project will utilize these methods to identify the molecules that enable one species to be distinguished from another so that it can be used to simply the identification of endangered species in the field.      title: research and development of an approach for non-invasive determination of cannabis ingestion for forensic science purposes   abstract the ultimate goal and approach of the proposed work is to confirm that there are chemical markers indicative of marijuana ingestion (as opposed to simply handling marijuana, or not using/handling marijuana at all) that appear in fingerprint residue, and that these can be detected by machine learning processing of the chemical profiles of fingerprint residues from: (a) donors who have neither handled nor ingested marijuana; (b) donors who have handled but not ingested marijuana; and (c) donors who have handled and ingested marijuana. upon identification of these chemical markers (i.e., m/z values), maldi mass spectrometry imaging (msi) will be used to determine which subset of them reveal ion images in the form of the fingerprint of the donor, since these have the potential to be used to develop a field-deployable device for their detection. once the m/z values that readily can be detected in the form of a fingerprint in maldi-msi experiments have been identified, they will be isolated and structurally characterized and identified using a combination of chromatographic (gc/ms and/or lc/ms, and preparative lc), mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques (e.g., ftir, nmr). based on ion images of the m/z values corresponding to the chemical compounds that are indicative of marijuana ingestion and which reveal the fingerprint of the donor, a direct link between marijuana usage and the identity of the individual (based on the ridge pattern detail) can also be established. future work can then aim to develop a rapid, antibody-based approach that allows for the detection of marijuana ingestion in the field from an easily collected fingerprint. the aforementioned proposal will be investigated through the pursuit of the following three objectives/specific aims:  specific aim i: analysis of fingerprint residues of marijuana users, non-users and handlers, using dart-hrms, followed by advanced statistical analysis of the acquired spectra, to reveal the unique biomarkers (m/z values) that distinguish between consumption, handling and non-exposure.  specific aim ii: utilization of maldi mass spectrometry imaging to determine which of the discovered m/z values (from specific aim i) that are associated with marijuana ingestion will reveal the fingerprint ridge pattern in the form of an ion image of the ridge pattern. specific aim iii: determination, using chromatographic and structural characterization methods, of the identities of biomarkers revealed to be associated with marijuana ingestion, and from which the fingerprint ridge pattern is revealed on maldi-ms analysis.    abstract:  this project aims to develop a technology to rapidly identity the tree species from which felled timber and products made from it are derived, in order to support: (1) compliance with national and international timber trade laws; and (2) environmental sustainability. the research proposed herein would exploit the capabilities of direct analysis in real time - mass spectrometry (dart-ms) in enabling the rapid screening of minute amounts of samples in seconds, without the need for sample pre-treatment steps. the technology relies on knowledge of the species-specific chemical \"fingerprints\" of trees, and the processing of this information using a mathematical algorithm to generate accurate species identity information. furthermore, it would enable attribution of not only wood species, but also the chemical markers that enable species to be distinguished from one another. in addition, information on mixtures of species (representing composite materials), geographical origin and age will be investigated. this work will be accomplished through the pursuit of the following specific aims: specific aim i: development of a wood species identification approach for domestic species; specific aim ii: development and testing of a method to identify species within composites (i.e. mixed materials); specific aim iii: development and testing of a method to identify the geographical origin of samples of the same species; and specific aim iv: development and testing of a method to determine the age of different samples of the same species. the realization of these goals will ultimately support the development of rapid means by which to perform wood species identification. the results will: (1) empower organizations fighting illegal logging with an accurate and affordable tool for forensic identifications; (2) enable wood certification along supply chains without delaying the movement of goods; (3) provide a means for companies to achieve reproducibility in composite materials; and (4) encourage recycling of wood byproducts thereby supporting sustainability measures.

    "kaalak reddy": "project abstract bi-allelic loss of function mutations in the itpa gene cause a severe multisystem developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, congenital bilateral cataracts, and a fatal infantile dilated cardiomyopathy. itpa encodes the inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (itpase) enzyme that prevents accumulation of the non-canonical nucleotide inosine within the nucleotide pool by dephosphorylating both ditp and itp and thus preventing misincorporation during dna and rna synthesis. although the biochemical activity of itpase is well understood, the molecular and cellular basis of pathogenesis resulting from itpase deficiency is unknown. itpase-deficient patient cells and itpa-null mouse embryonic cells and tissues contain misincorporated inosine within the rna, but inosine is undetectable within dna which may be due to active dna repair processes. to investigate the functional consequences of itpase deficiency and inosine misincorporation in the transcriptome; aim 1) rna sequencing (rna-seq) will be performed on crispr/cas9-derived itpa-null mouse embryonic stem cells and tissues to evaluate transcriptome deregulation and aim 2) inosine rna immunoprecipitation coupled to rna-seq (inosine rip-seq) will be performed on crispr/cas9 derived itpa-null mouse embryonic cells and tissues to identify the specific transcripts containing misincorporated inosine. the proposed work will identify transcriptomic alterations resulting from itpase deficiency. identifying the transcripts that contain misincorporated inosine and defining the functional effect of this misincorporation, is an important step in elucidating the pathogenic mechanism of itpase-deficiency and may reveal novel factors important for healthy development. in the long term, itpase deficiency will be studied as a model developmental disorder to better understand the gene regulatory networks active during organogenesis and how to manage alterations to this crucial program during development.

    "james boswell": "abstract we are experiencing an urgent, global surge in mental health needs. pre-covid-19, most behavioral health consumers took an average of two-years to find effective treatment. post-covid, this gap between need and access to services will likely increase. the proposed product, marketplace, aims to even out the supply and demand problems while steering consumers towards therapies that have doubled the effectiveness of other approaches.  as covid-19 changes the health delivery landscape, computer searches are likely to increase, as well as the frustration with the current yellow-page type listings. we propose to develop a new product, marketplace, to help people find therapists for traditional therapy by distance search or telemedicine by state or national searches who are matched with a person's needs based on the therapist's historical client outcome data, and are currently accepting new patients.  the proposed phase i grant will be to create and test a prototype of marketplace, a flexible, secure system on the internet in which clients' anonymous behavioral health intake self-assessment reports are shared with prospective therapists who meet the clients' minimum preferences for age, distance, insurance, etc. (and, ultimately, are a good scientific match).  the project aims will be to (a) create a prototype of marketplace; (b) conduct focus groups with key stakeholders about the marketplace concept; and (c) conduct acceptance testing with key stakeholders. while the science behind outcome referrals, inc.'s matching algorithms have been tested in other federally-funded research with adults, its application and dissemination to the public via managed care organizations is required to ensure a significant public health impact on growing behavioral health needs in our communities.    abstract the project team tested a new system for matching mental health care (mhc) patients to therapists who have strengths in treating patients' specific presenting concern(s). this work followed prior research demonstrating that most mhc therapists have some strengths and some weaknesses in treating patients with different mental health problems, which suggested that such performance information (i.e., multidimensional effectiveness \"report cards\") could be used to improve patients' therapy outcomes. results indicated that match versus case assignment as usual (cau) patients showed significantly more improvement in their symptoms/functioning. the positive effect of matching was especially strong for patients who identified as racial/ethnic minorities. the positive effect was also stronger for patients with more versus less severe mental health concerns. thus, research underscores that mhc can be improved not just by developing and using evidence-based interventions, but also by harnessing therapist performance information to determine personalized patient-therapist matches. despite this promise, routine case assignment in mhc is largely based on convenience and therapist self-identified expertise (which is often overestimated), leaving it to chance whether patients will be assigned to objectively good- versus poor-fitting therapists. with the strong trial results, the project team will implement the match system widely. in phase 1, the team aims to demonstrate that routine assessment, development of therapist report cards, and prospective matching can be integrated into the current operations within a large regional mhc network in the philadelphia area. in phase 2, the team will rely on the information gathered, materials developed, and lessons learned in phase 1 to rapidly replicate its implementation efforts more widely across the largest national network of mhc centers. the team's overarching evidence-based implementation strategy will follow the framework for dissemination (ffd), further informed by the dynamic sustainability framework, which approaches implementation with the expectation that some degree of adaptation will be necessary for sustainment. activities in partner mhc networks will include working with an implementation team to integrate the match system into the existing electronic health record, establish training protocols for future adoptions, assess and refine the match system to meet the network's needs, and demonstrate fidelity and beneficial patient treatment outcomes that meet or exceed those observed in the trial. the potential for future uptake and sustainability is extremely high, as this is a minimalist, readily scalable intervention.

    "shaghayegh sahebi": "  ai institute: multi-objective career-oriented study path recommendations shaghayegh sahebi november 2020 the goal of this proposal is to support adult learners, university students, and advisors by recommending personalized, goal-oriented, and multi-resource study paths for students.  as the job markets evolve, and interdisciplinary and non-degree  programs  are  created,  it  is  essential  to  devise  more  flexible  and personalized  study  paths  to  train  the  learners  towards  their  goals,  including their desired career. course recommendations have been one of the main research challenges of ai in education for more than a decade.  the early course recommenders either relied on heuristic methods only to satisfy program schedule requirements [11] or on traditional recommendation models, such as association rule mining, to estimate student performance in them or recommend courses according to co- enrollment in students [1, 20].  these methods ignored the complexity of learner motivations and objectives and the heterogeneous sources of information that can be used in addressing this complexity.  even to date, many course recom- mendations methods, despite proposing state-of-the-art models and algorithms, ignore this complexity and aim to recommend courses that will be highly rated by the student [21], or are interesting to the student [7, 13], according to similar students’ behavior.  a few recent researches have studied goal-based recommen- dations [6] and multi-objectivity in students’ choice of courses [5, 9].  however, the association between student career objectives,  interests,  success rate,  and program structure is ignored in the literature. this gap in the literature is due to the scarcity of rich datasets and several research challenges to solve this problem,  including optimally using heteroge- neous, noisy, and multi-granular data sources, and balancing between different objectives.  an ideal solution should consider heterogeneous data sources, such as students’ grades, history, and demographics, programs’ structure, course and offering diversity, and requirements, and alumni careers and their history as stu- dents, to devise a holistic model for study plan recommendations.  it should deal with missing and noisy data, such as transfer students’ history and current stu- dents’ future performance in courses, and take into account multi-granular ob- servations, including students’ within-course and between-course performances. finally, it should recognize and balance multiple objectives, such as learner in- terests, career goals, ability, and performance, and constraints, such as program 1  length and prerequisites. in  this  proposal,  we  aim  to  devise  study  plan  recommender  models  and algorithms  that  address  the  above  challenges.   in  the  first  year  of  the  pro- posal,  we  will  develop  student  grade  prediction  methods,  inspired  by  matrix completion [2], collaborative filtering [12], and student performance prediction models [4, 18], to address the missing and noisy data problem.  in the second year  of  the  proposal,  we  will  research  multi-recourse  and  multi-view  models, adopting  cross-domain  recommender  systems  [17,  15]  and  multi-view  knowl- edge  models  [22]  to  take  into  account  heterogeneous  and  multi-granular  data sources in student performance prediction.  in the third year,  we will develop performance-oriented course recommendations adopting cross-domain[3, 16] and multi-objective [8] recommender systems to the education domain.  in the fourth year of this proposal, we will study the associations between potential careers and student data resources,  including student history and alumni current ca- reers, using discriminative pattern recognition methods [10] and canonical cor- relation analysis with missing data [14, 19], to guide our career-oriented study path recommendations.  accordingly, we will develop career prospect prediction models  for  learners.   finally,  in  the  fifth  year,  we  will  research  on  suggesting courses  and  study  planning  for  learners,  balancing  between  multiple  learner objectives,  building  on  the  developed  performance  prediction  models,  career prospect  models,  and  multi-objective  performance  and  career-oriented  course recommendations.  during all five years, we will iteratively design and develop an interactive application for students to suggest courses to them and collect their feedback on the recommendations.  at the same time,  we will seek aca- demic advisors’ expert opinion on the course recommendations and the interface for its improvement.  this proposal provides a unique opportunity to tackle the multi-objective career-oriented study-path recommendation problem by resolv- ing the data scarcity obstacle.  particularly, university at albany - suny has a rich database of within-course activities, in addition to the institutional data, that can be harnessed to add fine-grained information to the models.  addition- ally, university at albany - suny is in close contact with the alumni, collecting yearly bachelor’s degree recipients surveys and first destination surveys that can help in predicting career prospects for learners. references [1]  n. bendakir and e. a ̈ımeur.  using association rules for course recommen- dation. inproceedings of the aaai workshop on educational data mining, volume 3, pages 1–10, 2006.

investigate  a  new  generation  of  educational  recom- mendation and personalization systems that are capable of suggesting learning materials of heterogeneous types, according to multiple learning and behavioral goals, in continuous time to students.  online learning environments are increasingly used for student and workforce training.  with a less imposed structure and reduced teacher-student interactions, automatic tools such as educational recommender systems that help students organize their activity sequences have become vital in these environments.  yet, current educational recommender methods predominantly focus on instructing one type of learning material that can be assessed (e.g., problems), in pursuit of one objective (e.g., knowledge increase), considering discrete learning times (e.g., student attempts). this project is the first to research time-aware multi-objective multi-type personalized educational rec- ommender models and algorithms that are capable of suggesting both assessed and non-assessed types of learning materials to students, considering students’ learning interests, behavioral preferences, and learning goals, and estimating students’ needs in continuous time by modeling between-activity time intervals.  we realize this contribution via three research thrusts at the intersection of educational data mining,  recom- mendation systems,  temporal process modeling,  and reinforcement learning fields.  in our first thrust,  we devise a framework for detecting students’ various goals while letting students choose the next learning mate- rial.  next, we investigate multi-type knowledge modeling and suggesting both assessed (e.g., problems) and non-assessed (e.g., video lectures) learning materials to students, while considering their multiple objectives. finally, we propose a new modality of educational recommender systems by incorporating process modeling for between-activity influence and interval learning into our recommender systems. intellectual merit.this research will introduce the first holistic time-aware multi-objective framework for recommending heterogeneous learning material types to students.  it draws on educational data mining, recommender systems, temporal process modeling, and reinforcement learning literature and extends each of them by adding choice modeling to instructional sequencing, quantifying multi-material knowledge gain in student models, balancing multi-objective models in cross-domain recommender systems, and bridging the gap between marked temporal point processes and hierarchical reinforcement learning.  this research will contribute significant actionable insights into influence of different goals, learning material types, and time management strategies in student learning.  integration of research outcomes into online education systems will allow reproducible research and education, while providing empirical evidence for their evaluation. broader impacts.this project’s research provides open-source and readily usable tools to improve person- alized online education and will be integrated with online environments used in classes across collaborating institutions.  scientifically, this research can be used to develop models in a variety of personalized applica- tions with user choice and multiple objectives, such as in personalized healthcare, recommender systems, and social media.  the proposed solutions will be presented in journals and venues with strong industry presence and will be accessible through public repositories to reduce barriers to adoption in the broader community. also, the results will provide actionable evidence for education theory research as the pi is closely collabo- rating with the education department of ualbany.  for mentorship and education, the pi will build on the diversity of her lab to promote this interdisciplinary and collaborative field to under-represented students. 2    proposed undergraduate research work the pi is proposing to recruit two undergraduate students using this reu supplement.  the two un- dergraduate  students  will  develop  knowledge  and  skills  in  machine  learning,  recommender  systems,  and educational data mining by being involved in various learning opportunities, including collecting, exporting, and pre-processing datasets for research purposes, interpreting and analysis of data, reading on and compre- hending machine learning models for the project, running models and algorithms on the datasets, exploring and interpreting the results of these algorithms, writing technical reports, and presenting research to their peers as expert audience. 3    mentoring the  two  undergraduate  students  will  join  the  pi’s  lab,  personalized  ai  (persai)  lab.   the  pi’s  lab currently  hosts  three  ph.d.  students  (two  female  and  one  male)  and  one  female  undergraduate  student. the pi keeps regular online and offline project and group meetings through zoom and in-person, and uses the  slack  messaging  application  for  a  faster  communication  with  her  lab  members.   this  will  provide  an 1  reu: career: time-aware multi-objective recommendation in online learning ...s. sahebi opportunity  for  the  undergraduate  students  to  meet  all  lab  members  and  work  with  them.   each  of  the undergraduate students will be working closely with at least one ph.d. student.  at the same time,  they will be communicating with and receiving advice from all senior members of the lab.  by attending weekly group meetings, they will present their research, receive feedback from all lab members on their project, and participate in research discussions of all projects in the lab.  the pi and students will develop a plan for the whole research period at its beginning.  the pi will have weekly, and on-demand, individual meetings with the two students to discuss their progress.  at the end of the research period, the students will write a technical report summarizing their research.  accordingly,  the reu funds will provide a comprehensive research experience to the undergraduate students by performing research tasks in this project, presenting their research in group meetings and in writing,  and being exposed to other research projects in the lab. moreover, the phd students will gain mentorship experience by guiding the undergraduate researchers in their research tasks. 4    selection process upon availability of the reu funds, the positions will be advertised in two levels:  to ualbany under- graduate students, and to the undergraduate community in the capital region of new york state.  within ualbany, the pi will broadcast the positions through the undergraduate mailing lists of ualbany acm-w chapter, college of engineering and applied sciences, and the honors college.  the pi will also reach out to the access and academic enrichment programs in ualbany (https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_ bulletin/academic_support_services.html) to make sure the announcements are advertised to the stu- dents from underrepresented groups and with low-income backgrounds.  the capital region of new york state includes multiple colleges and universities with computer-science related programs, such as skidmore college,  college of saint rose,  hudson valley community college,  and schenectady county community college.  the pi will advertise the opportunity to these colleges and universities across the capital region of new york state to reach a broader audience.  the pi acknowledges that all students to be funded will be u.s. citizens, u.s. nationals, or permanent residents of the united states.  this requirement will be clearly communicated as the positions are advertised. 5    past history the pi is devoted to involving undergraduate students in research, by engaging them in her research lab and by integrating research-oriented projects in her undergraduate-level courses.  so far, the pi has advised three  undergraduate  students  through  the  reu  program,  four  other  undergraduate  students,  seventeen m.sc.  students, four ph.d. students (including one who has graduated), one visiting scholar, and one post- doctoral scholar.  she has served on the dissertation committees of eight phd students.  the pi has taught four  undergraduate  courses  (data  mining,  introduction  to  artificial  intelligence,  database  systems,  and numerical methods for digital computers), all of which included small-scale research projects. 6    stipend details the reu supplement funds will be used in summer 2022 to provide participant support for two under- graduate students. 7    budget justification stipends:  the  budget  includes  two  undergraduate  students  that  will  be  supported  with  a  stipend  of $320.00 weekly.  in addition, $180 per week is budgeted for food, rent, purchasing books, and other materials for each student.  the time period will cover 16 weeks over the summer (may-september 2022).  if the pi is  unsuccessful  hiring  the  undergraduate  students  this  summer,  she  will  continue  the  hiring  and  training until the end date of her current nsf career project.  the students will be involved in research activities during their reu learning experience including:  design and evaluation of the proposed research methods and techniques as well as integration of experimental systems, participation in weekly meetings, learning to write technical papers and dissemination of developed tools and results. 2",
    "lance bosart": "  project title:  the upstream dynamical control and downstream impacts of recurving eastern north  pacific tropical cyclones    overview:  a subset of warm-core tropical cyclones (tcs) that form over the oceanic tropics will recurve  into  higher latitudes where  they will  either  slowly  dissipate as  they  lose  their  warm-core  tropical  characteristics  or transition  into  a  cold-core, baroclinic  extratropical  cyclones  (ecs)  in  regions  of  strong  baroclinicity. the process whereby a warm-core tc transitions into a baroclinic ec is called extratropical  transition (et). a further subset of tcs that undergo et may redevelop into intense baroclinic ecs that  can pose hazards both to seafarers, due to large waves and high winds, and landlubbers due to damaging  winds, heavy rains, and inland flooding. et is most common in autumn when the meridional temperature  gradient increases and the jet stream strengthens as higher latitudes cool relative to the tropics. although  approximately  40–50%  of  tcs  over  the  western  pacific (wpac) and  western  atlantic  undergo  et,  the  percentage of tcs that undergo et in the eastern pacific (epac) is much lower at ~10%. this proposal  targets understanding why et in the epac is so rare relative to the wpac and western atlantic (watl).     intellectual merit: six testable science hypotheses are proposed centered on these ideas: 1) the absence of  a strong polar jet over the epac in autumn limits the opportunity for recurving tcs to interact with jet- related  baroclinic  zones  and  undergo  et; 2)  intermediate-sized, “goldilocks”, upper-level  troughs  associated with cyclonic rossby wave breaking, vigorous quasi-geostrophic ascent, deep tropical moisture,  and  downshear  ridge  building, the  most  conducive  to  favorable  tc–trough  interactions are  rare in  the  epac; 3) the ability of recurving wpac tcs that undergo et to lead to downstream flow amplification  favorable for et seldom extends past the central pacific; 4) recurving tcs that interact with subtropical,  upper-level, closed cyclones that  maximize in autumn over the epac are often unfavorable for et because  of an absence of significant low- and mid-level baroclinicity; 5) the epac subtropical jet (stj) has fewer  chances  to  interact  with  recurving  tcs  due  to little overlap with the active tc  season; and, 6) a  higher   subtropical  tropopause  limits  the  ability  of upper-level  baroclinic  disturbances embedded  in  the  stj to  induce et in conjunction with an absence of strong low- and mid-level baroclinicity that would facilitate  et. we propose to test these hypotheses by means of detailed climatological, composite, and case study  analyses.  we  will  focus  on  understanding  how:  1)  the  structure  and  evolution  of  the  north  pacific  stj  governs where and when et will occur during autumn, 2) recurving wpac tcs that undergo et perturb  the downstream flow to permit epac et, and 3) a small subset of epac tcs that undergo et can have  significant downstream impacts (e.g., severe flooding) on the western and central conus.    broader  impacts: the  broader  impacts  of  this  proposal  include  the  specialized  research  training  and  advanced  scientific  education  of  graduate  students, and  contributions  to  the  synoptic–dynamic  research  community. the specialized research training and advanced scientific education of the project-supported  graduate students emphasizes a fundamental understanding of the structure and behavior of the atmosphere,  and provides a firm conceptual and technical foundation for their future professional careers. on a career  time scale, our ongoing practice of paying close attention to global weather events has been successful in  identifying potential research issues and opportunities of interest to the synoptic–dynamic, weather analysis  and forecasting, and tropical research communities. we anticipate working with operational forecasters in  the  san  diego  office  of  the  national  weather  service  to both help  transition our  research  findings  into  operations and  to  better  inform  us  of  hazards  associated  with  landfalling  tcs  that  undergo  et  over  the  western  conus  (e.g.,  the  increased  potential  for  coastal  california  wildfires  associated  with  strong  downslope easterly flow ahead of landfalling and transitioning tcs). finally, as an inaugural member of  the american geophysical union’s bridge program, we will recruit a master’s student from the program’s  applicants, which include women and underrepresented minorities.    project title: the governing dynamics  and predictability of  recurving  eastern  north  pacific  tropical   cyclones    overview:   a subset of tropical cyclones (tcs) that form over the tropics will recurve into higher latitudes where they  will either slowly dissipate as they lose their warm-core tropical characteristics or transition into a cold- core, baroclinic  extratropical  cyclones  (ecs)  in  regions  of  strong  baroclinicity.  the  process  whereby  a   warm-core tc transitions into a baroclinic ec is called extratropical transition (et). a further subset of  tcs that undergo et may redevelop into intense baroclinic ecs that can pose hazards both to seafarers,  due  to  large  waves  and  high  winds,   and  landlubbers  due  to  damaging  winds,  heavy  rains,  and  inland   flooding. et is most common in autumn when the meridional temperature gradient increases and the jet  stream strengthens as higher latitudes cool relative to the tropics. although approximately 40–50% of tcs  over  the  western  pacific  (wpac) and north  atlantic (natl) undergo  et,  the  percentage  of  tcs  that   undergo et in the eastern pacific (epac) is much lower at ~10%. this proposal targets understanding why  et in the epac is so rare relative to the wpac and natl.     four testable hypotheses are proposed centered on these ideas: 1) epac et events are rare compared to  wpac and watl et events because midlatitude baroclinic jet–trough systems are less likely to interact  with  recurving  epac  tcs;  2)  intermediate-sized,  “goldilocks”,  upper-level  troughs  associated  with   cyclonic rossby wave breaking, vigorous quasigeostrophic ascent, deep tropical moisture, and downshear  ridge building, which are the most conducive to favorable tc–trough interactions, are rare in the epac; 3)  the ability of recurving wpac tcs that undergo et to lead to downstream flow amplification favorable  for et seldom extends past the central pacific; and, 4) forecast patterns of potential vorticity (pv), 500-hpa  vorticity, and 850-hpa thermal advection across the north pacific before, during, and after tc recurvature  govern the strength and predictability of the et process.  we propose to test these hypotheses by means of  detailed climatological, composite, and case study analyses.    intellectual merit:  the proposed research seeks to better understand why et is comparatively rare and weak in the epac, and  to  place  epac  et  in  context  with  et  in  other  ocean  basins  through  dynamics-based  analyses. we  will   focus  on  understanding  how:  1)  recurving  wpac  tcs  that  undergo  et  perturb  the downstream flow to  permit epac et; 2) the morphology of midlatitude baroclinic jet–trough systems, pv streamers, and cutoff  cyclones determine where, and whether, et can occur in the epac; and, 3) a small subset of epac tcs  that undergo et can have significant downstream impacts (e.g., severe flooding) on the western and central  conus.    broader impacts:   the  broader  impacts  of  this  proposal  include  the  research  training  and  advanced  education  of  graduate   students,   scientific contributions  to  the  synoptic–dynamic  research  community,  and  a  commitment  to   continue  increasing  diversity  in  the  atmospheric  sciences.   first,  the  research  training  and  advanced   scientific education of the project-supported graduate students emphasizes a fundamental understanding of  the structure and behavior of the atmosphere,  and provides a firm conceptual and technical foundation for  their  future  professional  careers.  second,  our  results  will  be  discussed  and  disseminated  on  the   internationally-recognized ualbany map listserv, and we will work with operational forecasters in the san  diego office of the national weather service to both help transition our research findings into operations  and  to  better  inform  us  of  hazards  associated  with  landfalling  tcs  that  undergo  et  over  the  western   conus. finally, as an inaugural member of

abstract/research summary   the role of sea ice on the evolution of nearby arctic cyclones (acs), including their structure and  intensity,  is  largely  unknown,  leaving  gaps  in  the  understanding  of  weather- and  climate-scale  consequences related to interactions between acs and sea ice. in part, these gaps in understanding  stem from limited observations due to the arctic’s remote and harsh nature. to address these gaps  in understanding, the objectives of this research are to investigate the role of sea ice in the evolution  of ac structure and intensity, and to investigate the consequences of acs moving over sea ice.  the latter objective will include analyses of sea-ice fracturing, redistribution, and growth/erosion.   from  a  weather-based  perspective,  thorough  understanding  of  how  acs  and sea  ice  interact  is  useful  for  maritime  and  continental  interests.  for  mariners,  knowing  whether  an  ac  may  strengthen,  weaken,  or  meander  based  on  interactions  with  sea  ice  can  be  critical  for  mission  planning and navigation. strong winds associated with acs generate ocean waves, which have the  potential to fracture and/or redistribute sea ice, especially in the marginal ice zone (miz), which  typically  separates  open  ocean  from  consolidated  sea  ice.  conversely,  advective  and  diabatic  associated with acs may assist in regional sea-ice consolidation, particularly in the case of a cold- air outbreak. the fracturing, movement, or consolidation of sea ice by acs can be consequential  for maritime interests, as these processes can open or close navigation routes. further, as arctic  sea  ice  becomes  less  widespread  and  consolidated  in  summer,  forecasts  of  acs  may  become  increasingly important for navigation.   the  approach  to  address  the  aforementioned  research  objectives  will  begin  with  cataloging  applicable cases where acs translate over sea ice, using reanalysis and observational data where  available. case studies will illustrate various synoptic scenarios (e.g., synoptic-scale acs, weak  acs  with  quasi-zonal  flow,  and  acs  tied  to  interactions  with  tropospheric  polar  vortices).  the  cataloging  of  cases  will  include  evaluations  of  the  synoptic  environment,  which  will  identify  relevant  large-scale  features  that  may  affect  ac–sea-ice  interactions.  after  cataloging  cases,  a  coupled modeling framework will be adopted to conduct simulations of the cases with ac–sea- ice interactions. due to limited observational data documenting sea ice details (e.g., ice thickness  and type, floe size distribution) and surface fluxes near the sea-ice edge, the project aims to conduct  a suite of simulations that represents a range of assumptions about the character of sea ice. the  simulation suite will span a range of modeling complexity, which is anticipated to reveal relative  sensitivities of ac–sea-ice interactions to different modeling assumptions. one coupled modeling  framework  that  can  be  used  for  the  simulation  suite  is  the  national  oceanographic  and  atmospheric administration’s unified forecasting system (ufs). the ufs links models for the  atmosphere,  ocean,  sea  ice,  and  ocean  waves,  similar to the navy’s neptune system. as an  example, a testable hypothesis in the simulation suite using the coupled system is that ac intensity  is insensitive to miz floe sizes.   the project research is anticipated to yield presentations and peer-reviewed publications; the scope  of the project suggests that multiple manuscripts can be prepared and submitted for publication in  the refereed literature. research results may be pertinent to naval operations affected by acs and  sea ice. documentation for using the coupled modeling framework to conduct research also will   be  produced  and  made  available  to  researchers.  this  project  summary  is  approved  for  public  release.        project summary    the focus of the proposed work would be on the understanding of persistent flow regimes  (pfrs) across the northern hemisphere (nh), the dynamical and thermodynamical processes that  lead to pfrs, the statistical relationships pfrs have with various teleconnections, and how pfrs  are represented in s2s models. through case study analysis related to tyler leicht’s ms thesis,  two separate pfrs have been shown to heavily impact the duration and magnitude of temperature  and   precipitation   anomalies   across   western   north   america   (na)   broadly   and   california  specifically.  in  both  cases  mentioned  above,  a  deep  understanding  of  the  interactions  between  synoptic-scale  features  and  hemispheric-scale  flow  patterns  is  needed  to  explain  how  each  case  had  such  extended  periods of  anomalous  temperature  and  precipitation  patterns.  the  pi  and  graduate student have a unique set of skills to be able to investigate large-scale variability as well  as  a  keen  understanding  of  synoptic-dynamic  meteorology.  this  work  will  also  allow  for  the  completion of tyler’s phd thesis, building off previous ar program funding during his ms thesis.  once  completed,  the  goal  is  to  have  a  deeper  understanding  of  where  flow  patterns  are  first  perturbed  to  form  a  pfr,  how  far  in  advance  there  is  a  signal  of an  upcoming  pfr  determined  through both composite analysis and statistical relationships, and how pfrs and their governing  dynamics are biased in our current generation of s2s numerical weather prediction models. the  end goal would be to create an awareness of these patterns and communicate our research findings  to both meteorological and hydrologic forecasters on how these results can be incorporated into  their work. long term, it would be helpful to present these results to various modeling centers in  order  to  collaborate  on  model  improvements  needed  to  better  represent  the  dynamics  and  thermodynamics underpinning pfrs.

    "shao lin": "summary/abstract  the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is urgent, unpredictable, and massive in its impact on population health. while most prior research has focused on individual symptoms and risk factors for covid-19, the impacts of community-level factors on the person-to-person transmission of this highly contagious disease are less well-studied. community-level vulnerability/disparity to covid-19 is likely to be impacted by multiple factors throughout the total environment (i.e., natural, built and social environment). furthermore, community vulnerability likely changes dynamically over time depending on the local covid-19 control policies, and other economic or demographic trends and events (e.g., sudden loss of jobs/income, population mobility, protests and rioting) that have occurred during the covid-19 outbreak. some prior studies have examined single or limited environmental factors during a short period, but most have not considered the combined impacts of the total environment with other policy, economic, and demographic factors. also, no previous research has considered the temporal dynamics of vulnerability assessment. using traditional statistical methods to integrate and analyze large heterogeneous datasets across different domains with varying spatial and temporal scales is also quite challenging. to address these gaps, the overarching hypothesis of the proposed study is that people living in communities with less optimal natural, built and social environments, as well as less effective control policies, will have higher covid-19 infection and death rates. this hypothesis is tested through three aims: 1) to assess if the natural (weather factors, air pollution, and natural disasters) and built environment (green space) influence covid-19 outcomes; 2) to evaluate how the social environment interacts with covid-19 control policies (stay-at-home orders, etc.), community mobility, and protests to affect covid-19 infection; and 3) to develop a predictive model, a composite covid-19 community vulnerability (or resilience) index, and a vulnerability map that can accurately identify communities most at risk. in this retrospective cohort study, we will link data on two existing daily covid-19 outcomes (daily infection rates and death rates) with data on environmental factors and covid-19 control policies/related measures. innovative methods, including spatiotemporal poisson models, and a model coupling sir model with a neural network, as well as random forests, and interrupted time-series analysis will be used to evaluate the associations between the outcomes and total environmental factors, and evaluate dynamic long-term effects of control policies while controlling for temporal variables. the deliverables, including the predictive model, a vulnerability index weighed by risk factors, and an interactive map/website will serve as important and timely tools for covid-19 preparedness and intervention efforts. the study will be conducted by an excellent and multidisciplinary team of investigators, with access to key environment and social datasets, experience with innovative data mining and analysis methods, and a track record of successful prior partnerships with government agencies that will maximize our impact.    specific aims  the novel coronavirus of 2019 (covid-19) has caused the largest pandemic in the world. however, covid-19  does not affect all communities equally. growing evidence suggests that racial and ethnic minorities are more  susceptible to covid-19 infection, and experience more severe covid-19 complications and associated death.  unfortunately, these same groups may also experience multilevel barriers to testing or vaccination. decades of  empirical work has shown that disaster risk is socially distributed in ways that reflect pre-existing inequalities, in  that some groups are more prone to death, injury, and psychological impairment in the wake of differing hazards.  studies  on  disasters  and  minority  health  disparities  have  both  identified  a  perceived  lack  of  trust  among   minority  communities  with  regard  to  governmental  interventions.  therefore,  it  is  critical  to  comprehensively   assess how ethical, historical, social, economic, contextual factors, cultural beliefs and attitudes, care access,  expectations, and preferences influence these groups’ willingness and accessibility to get tested and vaccinated.  many previous studies only evaluated a limited range of barriers, ignoring factors such as normative beliefs, peer  influence,  and  incentive/disincentive  structures  in  the  social  and  community  environment  that  may  influence   testing  uptake.  in  addition,  few  studies  have  examined  factors  at  the  interpersonal,  institutional  (e.g.,  health   system), community, and policy levels that could jointly affect access to covid-19 testing among underserved  and/or  vulnerable  populations.  assessing  these  combined  impacts  requires  the  integration  and  utilization of  innovative models in disaster research, such as protective action decision model (padm) which provides a  multistage  model  that  allows  for  comparisons  across  groups  with  regard  to  their  understanding  of  risk  and   decision-making processes, and the pressure and release model (par) which explains the dynamic nature  of  social  vulnerability  in  the  face  of  major  events  by  considering  how  people  live,  their  access  to  various   resources, the influence of policies, and levels of discrimination. guided by these models, the overarching goals  of  this  project  is  to  evaluate  how  risk  perception  and  access  to  covid-19  testing,  governmental  control  policies and communication strategies, and multiple domains of influence (individual behavior, community,  social and ethical factors, policies, risk communication, and health system) jointly affect individual decisions to  seek covid-19 testing and vaccination. the specific aims are described below:     1. identify  the  perceptions,  concerns,  and  access  to  covid-19  testing  and  vaccinations  among  racial/  ethnic   minorities using two nation-wide surveys   by testing the following hypotheses:   a. protective actions regarding covid-19 testing and vaccination among racial and ethnic minorities and  women will be higher than among their white male counterparts.   b.  perceived  availability  of,  and  actual  accessibility  to  covid-19  testing/vaccine among  racial/ethnic   minorities will be lower than among their white male counterparts.  c.  differences in perceived access, safety, and efficacy influence protective actions undertaken among  racial and ethnic minorities more than privacy and security concerns.  2. evaluate how control policies and risk communication strategies affect covid-19 infection/vaccine rates, and  identify if social and behavioral factors modify the effectiveness of policies and communication.  a. assess national control policies and their joint effects on covid-19 infection, death, and vaccine rates  using the innovative method of “conditional inference tree”.  b.  evaluate if governmental communication strategies in different states affect testing/vaccine rates.  c.  examine if the control policies are equally effective by social, ethical and behavior factors.   3.  assess  how  multiple  domains of  influence  (individual  behavior,  community,  social  and  ethical  factors,   policies,  risk  communication,  and  health  system)  identified  in  aim  1  &  2  jointly  affect  seeking  covid-19  testing/vaccine using innovative artificial intelligence methods.   a.   develop predictive models based on vulnerabilities from aims 1 & 2 using deep learning techniques.  b.   create a vulnerability index and vulnerability maps by weighing the contributing factors.  c.   develop online interactive interfaces and software packages for forecasting and preparedness.     the proposed study is built upon a strong scientific premise formed by both our own prior/ongoing work in risk  perception,  communication,  and  social/community  vulnerability  assessment,  as  well  as  well-established  theoretical models that explain how individuals can be expected to respond in the face of disaster (padm and  par).  furthermore,  by  leveraging  our  prior  partnership  with  minority  communities,  and  by  bridging  disaster   research  and  public  health  to  assess  multiple  domains  of  influence  on  covid testing/vaccine access  and   behavior, our study is timely and will address multiple knowledge gaps. the proposed work is innovative in its  use of multiple disaster research models and state-of-the-art data mining techniques, and in its goal of creating  unique, dynamic, evidence-based and sustainable deliverables (predictive models, vulnerability index/maps, and  interactive website) to promote covid-19 testing/vaccination uptake.   i. abstract cumulative health impacts at the intersection of climate change, environmental

institution: the research foundation for the suny, university at albany, suny, 1400 washington ave., msc 100a albany, ny 12222 project period and location: 3 years, 2022-2025; nys project cost: year 1: $293,561 direct, $164,394 indirect; year 2: $294,795 direct, $153,325 indirect; year 3: $297,298 direct, $146,613 indirect project summary:  objectives: we hypothesize that environmental hazards tend to cluster in underserved communities. the objective of the proposed project is to assess disparities of environmental exposure and environment-health association disparities, and how community and life-stage factors modify extreme weather-health associations.  approach: we will first improve exposure assessment by generating state-of-the-art, high-resolution daily weather and air pollution data. for aim 1, we will evaluate if the areas with higher proportions of underserved communities are exposed to higher levels of air or water pollution, experience more extreme weather-related disasters or power outage, and reside in areas proximate to various hazards sources as well as expose to higher cumulative environmental hazards than other areas. we will also implement community-based participatory research using personal monitors in a sub-sample of underserved communities to measure real-time exposure to particulate matters, surface temperature and selected health indicators, and questionnaire to collect in-/out-door exposures, perceptions, and knowledge of environmental hazards. in aim 2, we will evaluate short-/long-term effects of various environmental

    "sara zahler": "testing the phonological/executive memory hypothesis: a longitudinal examination l2 spanish gender knowledge and production research indicates that working memory (wm) plays a role in l2 acquisition by affecting learners' rate of acquisition of various l2 abilities, as well as their real-time processing and production of the l2 (e.g. williams, 2012). however, studies on the relationship between wm and l2 acquisition have varied immensely in their wm tasks, l2 abilities examined, and participant proficiency levels. meta-analyses suggest that higher phonological short-term memory (pstm) - the component of wm that involves the short-term storage of verbal information - facilitates the acquisition of l2 vocabulary and grammar at earlier stages of l2 development. on the other hand, higher executive wm - the component involving the short-term storage of information as well as its manipulation during ongoing mental tasks - facilitates cognitively demanding real-time processing and production of the l2 (e.g. linck, osthus, koeth, & bunting, 2014). recently, wen (2015) proposed the phonological/executive model of wm and l2 acquisition, wherein pstm is facilitates the learning of the l2 at earlier stages, while executive wm is theorized to have a greater role in l2 processing and production at later stages. however, most research on this topic is overwhelmingly cross-sectional and correlational, while the few studies that are longitudinal generally only test wm at one time period, assuming it is static (jackson, 2020). nevertheless, recent research indicates that wm is mutable and improved via increased linguistic experience (huang, loerts, & steinkrauss, 2020).  thus, the current project proposes to employ a number of methodological \"best practices\" to examine the role of these two types of wm at different stages in the acquisition of l2 spanish gender marking with the following aims in mind: 1. to test the phonological/executive model of wm and its role in l2 acquisition; 2. to assess whether pstm and executive wm are mutable and improve with more linguistic experience; and 3. to determine causality, not correlation in the relationship between wm and l2 abilities.  native english-speaking university l2 learners of spanish will be assessed two times over a one year period (at the beginning and end of the year) on a measure of spanish gender marking evaluating learner knowledge of this structure, and an measure of spanish gender assessing its production in real time. learners will also complete instruments assessing vocabulary and grammatical proficiency. lastly, these learners will complete two measures each of pstm and executive wm at each time of data collection. the researcher will employ a latent variable analysis to ascertain a pstm and wm score for each participant, as suggested by conway, kane, bunting, hambrick, wilhelm and engle (2005).  the following findings are hypothesized. first, pstm will influence learners' acquisition of grammatical gender, as assessed via the offline knowledge measure, and this relationship will be stronger at time 1. second, executive wm will influence learners' accuracy in producing gender in l2 spanish in an online task, with a stronger effect found at time 2. lastly, learner wm abilities will increase with higher proficiency in the l2.  documenting instructor input in the spanish language classroom  we propose to create a publicly available corpus of transcriptions and recordings of the speech of university spanish instructors both within and outside the classroom that is tagged for language, topic, and part-of-speech. it is widely accepted that language input determines how learners' language skills develop beyond the effect of instruction, and university learners of spanish receive most of their input in the classroom. however, this input differs from how native speakers use spanish outside the classroom. thus, it is important to investigate the nature of classroom input to better understand its impact on learner linguistic development. since large samples of spanish instructor speech in language classrooms are not currently available, the study of this input is logistically difficult. a publicly available corpus of instructor speech would be a valuable resource to second language acquisition researchers and teacher educators alike, with implications for language pedagogy.

half-dozen laboratories  in the us  remain to train students in the handling  of extraordinarily reactive reagents  such as bromine  trifluoride,  chlorine fluoride or fluorine,  reagents  essential to fluorochemical research.  the  proposed research will sustain our ability to train students in this crucial area of chemical technology  and research.  2.  outreach to promote participation of under-represented groups.  seventh thru twelfth grade  students from historically underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged backgrounds  will be introduced to fluorine chemistry by engagement in mentored laboratory research, and in  collaborative, task oriented learning to understand the importance of chemical literacy in community  activism.  this outreach effort will have two separate components; a laboratory experience limited to  three students per academic year and an independent, saturday chemical literacy academy that will  be held for students interested in community action and the environmental impact of fluorochemicals  on the community.  as a mentor participating in the university at albany summer research program  for students from historically underrepresented groups (african-american, latino, and native  american), the pi has previously mentored many approximately 10 students in studies related to the  proposed work.  over the period of the current project, another 11 students from historically  underrepresented groups were or are engaged in project-supported research.  3.   infrastructure for research and education.  we maintain a dedicated laboratory equipped  with the necessary infrastructure (monel pressure reactors, stainless steel storage vessels, metal  vacuum lines, ptfe storage vessels and transfer systems, capacitance manometers, hi  performance vacuum systems with corrosion resistant oils, isolated ventilation and secure storage)  for the preparation, purification and characterization of both liquid and gaseous reactive fluorinated  intermediates and synthons.    4. benefits to society.  the centrality of fluorine chemistry in product development and in  currently marketed products for materials science, agrochemical, biochemical and medicinal  chemistry is endangered by the problem of environmental persistence.  of particular note is the  potential of the chemically and physically robust fluorinated hypervalent sulfur compounds to  decompose in an environmentally benign manner.     description of proposed effort.   on orbit application of polymeric adhesives or coatings can be confounded by the harsh environment.  conventional rapid polymerization reactions such as the photocuring of high solids acrylates is accelerated by moisture or in the case of epoxy polymers, curing can be highly dependent upon maintenance of elevated temperatures.  in addition, strict control of outgassing is required.  we are developing a novel chemically durable, thermally insensitive, and mechanically strong polymers based on our discovery of hard, heat-resistant, photocuring, tetrafluorosulfanyl-containing polymer that is formed by a novel photoaddition reaction of aryl tetrafluorosulfanyl chlorides, that proceeds without the need for exogenous photoinitiators.  when applied as a coating, these polymers can be rapidly photocured with uv irradiation to form hard, chemically resistant, thermally stable, and abrasion-resistant surfaces.  in the laboratory the curing process was determined to occur with no detectable outgassing and was effectively complete in 30 minutes. with high thermal stability and good adhesion in early laboratory tests, the polymers would seem to be easily adapted to on orbit repairs, assembly, or manufacturing.  rapidly cured coatings can be formed with no detectable emissions. the polymers have demonstrated stability at higher temperatures with only modest weight losses occurring at temperatures less than 500 °c.  early experiments on adhesion have shown that tetrafluorosulfanyl-containing films adhere so well to silicon surfaces that the substrate fails before the film releases.  the 1.0-2.8 gpa measured hardness of the native films is equivalent to or as much as ten times harder than that of other typical coatings. the comonomer constituents of are easily modified so that consequently the polymer properties may be readily tuned.  we propose to establish a structure curing relationship to establish optimum cure rates.  secondly, we will modify comonomer constituents to maximize desired mechanical and thermal properties.  initial characterization will follow military performance specification (mil-prf-85285e) enumerates a series of tests that aircraft coatings must meet for use by the dod and subsequently the appropriate nasa standard, e.g., nasa-std-6012, corrosion protection for space flight hardware.  we will pay special attention to effectiveness of the polymer on faying surfaces.  graduate and undergraduate students will engage in synthesis, physical organic, polymer science and materials chemistry.  they will have a multidisciplinary background and unique team working skills.  more than 20 students from traditionally underrepresented groups have made integral contributions to the pi's research program.  close cooperation with the university's science and technology entry program assures our continued success.     summary  on-orbit application of polymeric adhesives or coatings can be confounded by the harsh  environment.    conventional  rapid  polymerization  reactions  such  as

structure.  other applications include assembly  of  structural  members  by  environmental  irradiation  of  precoated  polymer  joints    or  composite assemblies.    both  strategies  accommodate  the  need  to  minimize  mass and  volume  needed  to  be  lifted  to  orbit.    preparation of prototype polymer  samples  will   advance the development and commercialization of this technology.

    "yanna liang": "prioritization of emerging organic contaminants in biosolids and their fate in soil-plant systems during biosolids land application  objectives and hypotheses. the overall goal of this project is to prioritize emerging organic contaminants (unregulated) in biosolids and elucidate their fate, transport, and interactions in soil-plant systems applied with contaminated biosolids. it will provide comprehensive information about the unregulated contaminants in biosolids that need a high-level of caution in land-application, in terms of their occurrence levels, mobility, bioaccumulation, as well as negative consequences when interacting with other components in soil-plant systems. the outcomes can guide agricultural practice and regulation. this overarching goal will be achieved by fulfilling the following three objectives and testing the associated hypotheses.  objective 1: identify and prioritize emerging organic contaminants (eoc) in biosolids from wwtps across the u.s.  hypothesis 1a: a variety of eoc can be found in biosolids from wwtps. those with frequent occurrence across many wwtps and high relative abundance are with high priority to investigate their fate, transport, and interactions with the other components in soil-plant systems. eoc profiles may also be indicative of certain influent sources, such as pfas industry, landfill leachate.    hypothesis 1b: comprehensive composition profiles of eoc in the biosolids can be obtained qualitatively and quantitatively by conducting suspect-screening with an inclusive pfas suspect list and by (semi)quantification using lc-(hr)ms/ms. objective 2: investigate fate, transport, and transformation of biosolids-associated eoc in soil. hypothesis 2a: the leaching of biosolid-associated eoc through soil profiles could be significantly accelerated because of the presence of large amounts of colloids in biosolids and the colloid-facilitated transport. hypothesis 2b: charges and structures of eoc affect the transport in soil. hypothesis 2c: certain eoc structures can be biotransformed by soil microbial communities, and in turn, the exposure to eoc can impact community compositions and important community functions for agricultural practice. objective 3: elucidate uptake, translocation, accumulation and transformation of highly prioritized contaminants in a soil-plant system applied with biosolids as an amendment.  hypothesis 3a: the fate and transport of eoc will differ in a more complex system when introducing plants in the biosolids-applied soil. the ability of the highly prioritized contaminants to passively cross root cell membrane for plant uptake is strongly affected by different charges and structures of the compounds. hypothesis 3b:  contaminants most likely to accumulate in aerial tissues are those entering the root via either passive diffusion into the symplastic pathway or transmembrane pathway into cells.     mri: acquisition of a trapped ion mobility spectrometer quadrupole time-of-flight (tims-qtof) with maldi for multidisciplinary research and education  overview: this proposal seeks to acquire a state-of-the-art trapped ion mobility spectrometry (tims) time of flight (tof) flex with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi). tim separation allows separating isomeric compounds. tof enables full mass-spectrum analysis and is capable to separate species that differ in mass by as little as 0.001 amu. mass spectrometry imaging (msi) is label free, provides untargeted analysis of thousands of molecular species simultaneously, and offers femtomole limits of detection. collectively, the proposed timstof with maldi is a high performance integrated dual electrospray ionization (esi)/maldi source ultra high resolution (uhr)-otof system designed to achieve world leading sensitivity in maldi operation. additionally, the acquired timstof maldi is the first commercially available system with maldi-2 post ionization.  intellectual merit: the proposed instrument will address critical challenges faced by researchers in multiple fields of research, such as environmental remediation, biomedical and biological sciences. this is enabled by the instrument's revolutionary capabilities in visualizing molecules in chemically complex microenvironments and providing quantitative compositional and structural analysis. in environmental remediation, this instrument will be used to detect and identify per- and polyfluorinated substances (pfas) in different environmental matrices. currently, among the > 5,000 pfas structures, only a few dozen have commercial standards. the lack of standard compounds, extremely low concentrations of pfas and the presence of mixed isomers with different properties and toxicities of these chemicals in the environment have been a bottleneck for researchers to fully understand their distribution and impact to the environment and human health. besides separating and identifying pfas, this instrument will also be used to image plant tissues and elucidate change of proteome, lipidome and metabolome upon exposure to pfas. in the field of glycomics, analyses performed by conventional ms measure only the most basic repeating units present in large polysaccharides but fail to provide the details of the organization of modifications (sulfation, uronic acid stereochemistry) into motifs that are critical to protein binding. the full structural characterization of carbohydrates (sp. sulfated glycosaminoglycans, gags) is a standing analytical need in the characterization of structure-function relationships as well as biomedical applications. the proposed equipment permits confident isomer differentiation and structure elucidation and provides a sensitive and rapid overview of glycan profiles for complex glycoprotein mixtures. with regard to the drosophila -parasitoid wasp interaction, the immune response of the host fly to another insect, the infecting wasp is largely unknown. the acquired instrument would enable deep understanding of changes at protein levels and localizing the cellular immune response through maldi imaging.   broader impact: at the time of writing, the capital region of ny does not have this instrument. this timstof with maldi will be used by researchers in at least four institutions and those at the ny department of health. housed on ualbany's campus, we will share this instrument with academic and industrial researchers beyond the capital region and ny state. annually, a workshop of on and off campus users will be held. besides expert-guided training to undergraduate researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from multiple disciplines, this instrument will be used for developing modules for a number of undergraduate and graduate level courses and showcased to the general public during our outreach events and through social media platforms.   collaborative: erase-pfas: stabilization of per- and polyfluorinated substances in sewage sludge intended for land-application overview: it is known that sewage sludge generated at wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) contains numerous per- and polyfluorinated substances (pfas). conventional processes for sludge stabilization to produce biosolids are not able to remove pfas completely. instead, some treatment processes may assist in releasing pfas from those bound to sludge particles and/or converting pfas precursors to perfluoroalkyl acids (pfaas). the presence of pfas in sludge and biosolids has been a huge concern given the fact that these biosolids are destined for land-application and may contaminate the environment where they are disposed of. in light of the million tons of biosolids generated in the u.s. every year and the persistence of pfas in biosolids, cost-effective and innovative approaches for preparing and enabling biosolids to still be land-applied must be identified. toward this end, we have found that a few sorbents are able to stabilize pfaas in sludge significantly. it remains unclear, however, whether this stabilization approach is applicable to a wide range of pfas precursors and whether stabilized pfas remain as immobilized in long-term. intellectual merit: the proposed project aims to test the central hypothesis that pfas precursors, either anionic, cationic or zwitterionic can be stabilized in biosolids upon amendment of a suitable sorbent. to identify such sorbents, the mechanisms underlying pfas binding to the sorbents must be elucidated. for this purpose, rationally designed sorbents with different compositions and properties will be tested on model precursor compounds. the effect of sorbents on decreasing or eliminating leaching of the precursors and their degradation products and on increasing or maximizing the formation of bound residues will be investigated in detail in systems with biosolids only, with biosolids mixed with soil and with plants. transformation, fate and distribution of the target precursor compounds will be understood through the combined experimental work and mathematical modelling. broader impact: success of this project will be game-changing as it leads to insights that can be used for making designer sorbents and a technology that permits biosolids to be land-applied without any negative consequences to the environment and human beings' health. besides benefits to the society, this project will provide opportunities to train the next generation of engineers and scientists. this training will be conducted at k-12, undergraduate and graduate levels. additionally, results from this project will be shared with the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, seminars, workshops and with the general public through social media outlets, such as podcast, facebook, twitter, radio and tv broadcasts, etc.   innovative and scalable processes for converting food waste to sustainable aviation fuel  project abstract  the concept of converting organic waste to volatile fatty acids (vfas, c2-c5) and transforming the vfas to sustainable aviation fuel (saf) has been proven. to scale up and commercialize this process, at least four challenges need to be overcome. first, the titer, production rate, and productivity of vfas from organic waste still need to be improved significantly. second, separating vfas at 10-30 g/l of fermentation broth has been a huge roadblock. third, catalytic pathways for upgrading vfas to fuels are lacking. although the concept of converting vfas to saf through ketonization followed by either hydrogenation/dehydration/ oligomerization or aldol condensation was proven successful, ketonization demands a high temperature and the process intensification is difficult. additionally, robust catalysts that are resistant to impurities in bio-derived vfa mixtures need to be designed and tested to ensure the robustness of the conversion process. fourth, comprehensive techno-economic analysis (tea) and life cycle analysis (lca) of the whole process from waste to fuels await to be performed to demonstrate the pathway's economic viability and environmental sustainability.   to address these challenges, the proposed technology seeks to integrate vfa production and vfa conversion to saf seamlessly. the focus of this project is to develop robust catalysts that are resistant to impurities in vfa streams. the vfa streams are derived from food waste through arrested methanogenesis (am) followed by separation. to design robust catalysts for converting vfas to fuel molecules, we will combine the power of computational and experimental work. specifically, we envision an iterative research loop, cycling between computations and experiments that will bring forth deep mechanistic insight with respect to the reactions and will ensure the rationally designed catalysts are improved upon iterations. using such a research approach, we previously demonstrated that bimetallic catalysts, such as ptsn, selectively convert carboxylic acids into equilibrated mixtures of aldehydes and alcohols, which are an ideal substrate for aldol/guerbet condensations that lead to long-chain alkanes that are appropriate for inclusion in saf.  this approach will be further explored for this project using simulated and real vfa mixtures.  the whole process will be subject to tea and lca to assess the cost-benefits and uncertainties of the project. these analyses will enable the team to compare the capital, operational, maintenance, and product costs of this technology with a conventional non-biobased technology (base-line economy). the tea and lca will also provide perspectives to the team on how to optimize the entire project.    project abstract proposal title:        agricultural waste-derived aviation fuels and advanced carbon materials for enhancing bioeconomy, climate change mitigation, and environmental sustainability  in collaboration with the lead pi at texas a&m university and other co-pis and senior personnel involved in this project, dr. liang's lab will help address challenges faced in the field of sustainable agriculture. in particular, dr. liang's lab will focus on converting dairy manure to volatile fatty acids (vfas). this pathway involves pretreating the manure, using anaerobic digestion to convert organics to vfas and extracting vfas out of the fermentation broth. the concentrated vfas can then be used to produce sustainable aviation fuels. in addition to the bench-scale tests, dr. liang will also lend her expertise and knowledge to the whole team in terms of scaling up the proposed processes and training farmers to gain first-hand experience in operating and maintaining the digestors.  assessing plant uptake of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) in soil  exposed to these emerging contaminants   the purpose of this project is to assess the potential of perennial grasses planted through the conservation reserve program (crp) to be utilized as a form of phytoextraction to remediate farm fields contaminated with pfas, the risks of doing so, and propose management actions to prevent the further spread of pfas on program enrolled fields. to accomplish the purpose, we seek to pursue four specific objectives: 1) evaluate the potential of uptake of pfas by perennial grasses native to the state of maine. this comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in a greenhouse first followed by field studies. 2) assess the approach of hydrothermal liquefaction (htl) for destroying pfas accumulated in the aboveground part of the grass. htl will be performed at milliliter to gallon scales. 3) understand impact of pfas to different grass species with respect to visible plant growth, biomass weight, and effects at the molecular levels. deep understanding at the molecular levels, such as lipidome, proteome, and metabolome will be enabled by a next generation trapped ion mobility spectrometry (tims) time of flight (tof) flex with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi).  4) model the fate and distribution of pfas in the grass-biosolids-soil systems based on theoretical calculations and experimental results. predictions generated by the models will help us propose management actions and best practices to prevent the further spread of pfas on target fields.       project summary      instructions:  the summary is limited to 250 words. the names and affiliated organizations of all project directors/principal investigators (pd/pi) should be listed in  addition to the title of the project. the summary should be a self-contained, specific description of the activity to be undertaken and should focus on: overall  project goal(s) and supporting objectives; plans to accomplish project goal(s); and relevance of the project to the goals of the program. the importance of a  concise, informative project

management, and mitigation  pd:   guo, bo institution:  university of arizona  co-pd:  brusseau, mark, l. institution:  university of arizona      treated wastewater is increasingly used for irrigation and >51% of biosolids produced in the us  are currently land applied. because per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas)—emerging  contaminants of critical concern—are not removed during the standard treatment processes, pfas  are widely present in the treated wastewater and biosolids used in agriculture. the ubiquitous pfas  pose significant long-term risks of contamination to soil health and groundwater quality at  agricultural sites. while these risks seriously threaten agricultural sustainability, there is limited  information to address and solve this critical issue. the proposed project combines experimental  and modeling approaches to advance the crucial understanding of the fate and transport of pfas at  agricultural sites and develop practical process-based tools to characterize, manage, and mitigate  the long-term contamination risks. the project objectives are: 1) understand and quantify the  primary factors controlling the fate and transport of pfas under agricultural conditions using high- resolution transport and lysimeter experiments; 2) develop and test process-based models for  predicting the fate and transport of pfas at agricultural sites; 3) develop, evaluate, and apply a  user-friendly screening tool for characterizing, managing, and mitigating pfas contamination at  agricultural sites. the screening tool will help stakeholders and other practitioners to develop  guidelines for strategies to manage and mitigate the long-term contamination risks of pfas for soil  health and water quality at sites, and ultimately preserve agricultural productivity. the project  responds to the program area priority bioenergy, natural resources, and environment and the  subpriorities “soil health” and “water quantity and quality”.

causing faculty to rely on instruments at other universities, which is a severe hindrance to research.  the requested new diffractometer will provide new capabilities and represents the growing materials  chemistry interest across a multidisciplinary group of professors from the department of chemistry and  the department of environmental engineering & sustainability. acquiring the new instrument will ensure  continual diffraction capability at any time on campus and retire the obsolete instrument. this new  instrument will raise the impact of at least six nsf-supported faculty and four assistant professors. the  instrument will be placed in a dedicated x-ray facility in the newly constructed emerging technology  and entrepreneurship complex at the university at albany, where the director of x-ray core facility  will maintain the diffractometer and supervise/train new users.    amorphous borides: a covalent analogue to metallic glasses  metallic glasses possess  many distinct advantages  over  their  crystalline  counterparts;  the  lack  of  structure means that typical failure points of defects  or  grain  boundaries  cannot  exist.  moreover,  the  jostled    arrangement    of    atoms    precludes    the  formation  of  slip  systems  as  one  expects  in  a  crystalline close packed lattice 1 . combining all this  together  results  in  a  cohesive  solid  that  has  high  strength,  wear  resistance,  and  elastic  strain  limits  (figure  1).  what  limits  metallic  glasses  from  exhibiting  truly  extraordinary  properties  is  their  metallic   bonding;   the   electron   density   around  metals   in   alloys   is   delocalized,   lowering   the  barriers towards bond breaking and bond forming.  contrast   this   with   covalent   bonds   where   the  electron  density  is  localized,  raising  the  barriers  towards bond breaking and dislocation movement.  this is part of the reason why metals such as copper  are ductile and soft while main group elements such  as diamond and boron nitride are hard 2 .   to   that   end,   there   has   been   several   attempts  towards the study of amorphous covalent materials.  one  prominent  class  has  been  the  six 2  family.   despite    all    these    advances,    the    anticipated  enhancement  of  mechanical  properties  from  six 2   have   a   fundamental   limitation   in   that   these  materials  are  not  fully  dense  because  they  are  all  corner-sharing  tetrahedra  linked  by  oxygen.  the  resulting  low  bond  density  counteracts  the  strong  bonding found in covalent bonds. it is unlikely that  there   will   be   any   advance   towards   compact  amorphous covalent ceramics without expanding to  new classes of materials.   higher  borides 5  (compounds  whose  high  boron  content  form  extended  covalent  networks)  are  an  overlooked candidate as their bonding geometries are so complicated they are almost amorphous. this is  reflected in the large unit cells required to describe higher borides. moreover, there are two knowledge gaps  the  proposed  work  would  address.  first,  there  is  the  knowledge  gap  in  the  mechanical  field  of  new  amorphous covalent ceramics. second, there is the knowledge gap in the solid-state chemistry field as all  our intuition comes from crystal structures, and by venturing towards materials that defy traditional ordering  we will uncover new mechanisms for strength enhancement and synthesis. we want to emphasize that while  there is a chemical covalent linkage with amorphous higher borides, the optoelectronic properties could be  metallic, and when we refer to amorphous covalent ceramics, we are discussing the network and not the  electrical conductivity. a classic example is zrb 12 , which has a 3-d covalent boron backbone but is metallic  in resistivity 6 .   figure 1. crystalline metals make up the bulk majority of  modern alloys; their strength is limited by the presence of  slip  planes  propagating  dislocations,  cracks  nucleating  defects/grain  boundaries,  and  metallic  bonding  enabling  deformation. metallic glasses do not possess crystallinity  and  ameliorate  slip  planes  and  defects,  but  are  still  dominated    by    metallic    bonding.    we    perceive    an  opportunity  in  the  development  of  amorphous  covalent  ceramics,   which   would   replace   the   weaker   metallic  bonding with covalent bonds. this would further raise the  barrier     towards     bond     breaking     and     dislocation  propagations.    objectives of the proposed work. we hypothesize that a new class of amorphous borides will possess  enhanced  properties  over  their  parent  crystalline  borides and conventional  metallic  glasses.  here,  the  bonding  is  primarily  covalent  instead  of metallic  and  with  it  brings  enhanced  strength.  we  will  first  use  magnetron sputtering to prepare amorphous metallic borides through the glass-inducing ability of boron.  our preliminary work has already indicated that a ~55 at.% critical threshold is needed for amorphization.  next, we will apply traditional “confusion principle” to borides so that amorphous borides can be prepared  as easily as metallic glasses. from there, new deintercalation procedures adapted from battery chemistry  will induce boron rearrangement, and our preliminary calculations have indicated that there are amorphous  boron  bonding  motifs  more  favorable  than  stable  β-boron.  the  insight  gained  from  combining  the  mechanical properties with structural (or lack thereof) chemistry of amorphous covalent ceramics will help  solve the knowledge gaps of both metallic glasses and ceramics.   the  intellectual  merit  of  the  proposed  work  will  tie  amorphous-property  relations between  amorphous  covalent networks to mechanical properties. the role of local bonding of the covalent network will play a  much stronger role than the nonexistent structure; this work is divergent from the field of structure-property  relationships. this unique synergy is achieved between the pi (mohammadi)’s experience in mechanical  characterization  and  thin  film  growth,  and  the  pi  (yeung)’s  solid  state  synthesis  and  structural  characterization. the pis mohammadi and yeung have had a long-time collaboration on the subject that  goes beyond a decade, the results of which have been published in several high-profile publications. 2, 7-14   this work straddles the field of mechanical engineering and chemistry, and the established collaboration  between  these  two  pi’s  will  provide  a  feedback  loop  so  that  exemplary  mechanical  behavior  will  be  explained structurally and iterated to better and better materials.  references  1. telford, m., the case for bulk metallic glass. materials today 2004, 7 (3), 36-43.  2. yeung, m. t.;

    "cheryl andam": "mechanisms of antibiotic production and resistance in microbial consortia  the global burden of antibiotic resistance remains critically high. in 2019, the united nations reported that diseases caused by drug-resistant bacteria cause at least 700,000 deaths/yr and are estimated to increase to an alarming 10 million deaths globally per year by 2050 if no action is taken immediately. the twin threat of antibiotic resistance and the potential loss of effective antibiotics without replacements has therefore catapulted infectious diseases to a global crisis of the 21st century. now more than ever, there is an urgent need to explore new strategies to target complex polymicrobial infections and multidrug resistant (mdr) strains. drugs can be combined to exploit synergistic activities, increase potency, widen their range of action, decrease dosage-related side-effects of individual drugs and slow down the emergence of resistance. the spectrum of potential drug-drug interactions is vast and multifaceted. it offers the promise of the best possible combination therapies tailored to specific treatment objectives and precision medicine. however, the major current bottleneck for rational design of combinations with desired outcomes is that the number of possible drug combinations grows exponentially with the number of drugs. this makes exhaustive screening with even a modest number of drugs intractable and daunting. moreover, all drug combinations developed to date come from empirical knowledge and ad hoc testing of already known antibiotics. hence, potent compounds with novel mechanisms of action, cellular targets or synergistic interactions remain undiscovered. these data highlight critical knowledge gaps with respect to designing effective drug combinations against mdr pathogens. recognizing the need to intensify efforts to slow down the rise of resistance, the 2020-2025 national action plan for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria called for work that would develop new treatments, including antibiotics, non-traditional therapeutics and optimized treatment regimens. we have an opportunity to study this by developing an innovative nature-inspired drug combination approach that is defined by the bacterial species that naturally produce antibiotics rather than using an artificial mixture of already known drugs.

    "boris goldfarb": "computation of algebraic k-theory of group rings r[g] is a problem of importance in both algebra and topology. in topology, the k-groups house many invariants associated to spaces with fundamental group g. one modern approach is through the study of so-called assembly maps. they relate the computable homology of the group g to it k-theory. the isomorphism conjecture asserts that the assembly maps are isomorphisms in all dimensions when the group has no torsion elements. recently i have verified this for most groups that appear in geometry and geometric group theory as a result of collaboration with gunnar carlsson. the method is to refine current techniques whenever they show such maps are injective and to use this refinement to prove subjectivity. this required, in particular, developing a new context called parametrized g-theory and novel excision techniques in that theory.  after these techniques are extended to algebraic l-theory and certain new permanence results for coarse coherence are obtained, all together the known facts will assemble into a proof of the celebrated borel conjecture on topological rigidity of compact aspherical manifolds (technically, compact manifolds with contractible covers) for a class of fundamental groups that contains all know examples of such manifolds.  this rigidity will result in a practical classification of these important manifolds.  in a complementary but related direction, i will develop geometric methods for divide-and-concur computational approaches in topological data analysis.  excision results in algebraic topology can be viewed as a way to distribute resource-expensive computations of algebraic invariants. when successful, such methods learn to assemble local computations into the global answer.  my recent work provides a workable solution of similar nature for persistent homology and applies the mapper algorithm to perform similar analyses of several other geometric computations in data sets: distributed discrete morse theory computations, stratification learning of data sets, application of mapper graphs to the traveling salesman problem, and others.  i plan to continue these collaborations within topological data analysis.

mitigateny, new york state's 2019 fema-approved hazard mitigation plan is the nation's first web-based statewide hazard mitigation plan. the 2019 new york state hazard mitigation plan (nyshmp) project team, encompassing new york state division of homeland security and emergency services (dhses), fema and the state university at albany department of geography and planning albany visualization and informatics lab (avail) staff, has been continuing to develop the non-proprietary, open source, data-forward, web-based planning platform.  one of the central goals of the nyshmp update is to deliver resources that can provide quality data and visualizations about hazard risk, historic events, associated losses, and mitigation actions at varying geographical levels for use in state and local hazard mitigation planning. the web-based tools developed by avail increase awareness of vulnerability and risk and provides a canvass for mitigation action development, to reduce risk to life and property from natural hazards. from the outset of the nyshmp update there has been a goal to create a web-based plan with a flexible, transferable foundation of centralized data and standard visualizations to support hazard mitigation plan updates and initiatives at both the local and state level. avail has demonstrated the capability to implement a high-quality web-based, software platform described herein. avail has also demonstrated the ability to effectively cooperate and coordinate with hazard mitigation and disaster management stakeholders as well as other public and private stakeholders. by partnering with fema, and with the support of dhses, avail intends to update the fusion disaster dataset in an effort to enhance efficiency, accuracy and relatability of data usage and interpretability across hazard mitigation planning projects and programs that will connect new york and fema region 2's efforts to states and regions across the nation. the following is an outline of the work to be conducted under this scope.  continue to build upon the hazarddata.org data program by adding modeled losses to the fusion dataset using a similar methodology to the billion-dollar dataset.  purchase and analyze private insurance data create white paper memo on what is included in the private insurance dataset utilize the private insurance data to create a complete picture of historic hazard loss  add the private insurance data into the fusion dataset (creating a billion-dollar dataset analog) explore options for including the data in a larger aggregated loss dataset explore modeling the data include insurance coverage over time and nfip policies data to allow modeling of nfip and private coverage by policies vs footprints in the flood zone and test losses against value of assets over time. update hazarddata.org to include the new research conduct outreach   task 8 -directly funded staffing instructions: please fill out the required

otherwise noted in tables 3-12 in part 1.2.2 in the custom scope elements cell(s), ctp is required to fulfill all scope required within the tasks described below. the activities outlined in this sow will be completed as specified in the cooperative agreement funding opportunity announcement, award notice, and/or articles of agreement. the sow may be terminated at the option of fema or the ctp in accordance with the provisions of the partnership agreement. if the sow is terminated, all products produced to date must be returned and remaining funds, provided by fema for this sow, from uncompleted activities will be returned to fema. the objective of the coms activity documented in this sow is to recognize and enhance activities undertaken by ctps that create an environment where communities: understand their flood risk and the importance of addressing that risk. are more willing to engage with the mapping partner and fema to analyze their risks. are better primed to take action to reduce their risk, based on that analysis. specifically, tasks funded under this sow support and enhance coms activities. all processes and deliverables shall be completed in accordance with fema's guidelines and standards for flood risk analysis and mapping, revision 12, dated december 2021 located on fema's website at www.fema.gov/guidelines-and-standards-flood-risk-analysis-and-mapping. these guidelines and standards define the specific implementation of the statutory and regulatory requirements for national flood insurance program (nfip) flood risk projects and address the performance of related risk map activities. coms tasks cannot result in the production of a flood insurance rate map (firm). the activity/activities that could be accomplished under the coms sow are as follows: coms engagement plan (required) strategic planning for community engagement meetings and process facilitation mitigation support communication and outreach to communities training and community capability development mitigation planning technical assistance pilot projects internal partner support activities: mentoring staffing coms engagement plan (required) intent: document prepared by recipients and used by regional offices in support of risk map multi-year planning. this plan should identify the overarching approach to community engagement, that will then be implemented on a project-by-project basis. this plan must: document the capabilities and accomplishments of the partner related to coms. for example, summarize the partner's capabilities to do community outreach and provide some examples of successful community outreach efforts. and/or provide an overview of the partners strategic approach to community engagement and critical factors in successfully engaging communities in reducing their risk. explain the recipient's vision for implementing or participating in risk map, specifically describing how the partner's activities advance the vision, goals and objectives of risk map for encouraging communities to take action to mitigate risk. include examples or updates from previous years' activities (if applicable). provide recommendations to fema regarding action and outreach potential for future risk map projects within the state, regional or local area. recipients that are also completing activities under the pm sow may combine business plan and the coms engagement plan for these two sows into a comprehensive business plan that includes the required elements for both the pm sow business plan and the coms sow engagement plan. recipients must work with their fema regional office for additional details and requirements of business/engagement plans, including due dates, for the state and/or local business plans. if ctp has both coms and pm sows, then the coms engagement plan will be combined with the business plan requirements of the pm and coms awards into a single deliverable, with approval from the fema regional po. if this is the case, make that notation in tables 3 to 12 in part 1.2.2. strategic planning for community outreach and engagement intent: the ctp will strategically prepare for engagement with communities and stakeholders, to strengthen and focus project discussions towards taking mitigation action to reduce natural hazard risk. this work can include the development of plans, to create a framework for action throughout a project, and/or can also include outreach activities with the community, to facilitate its forwarding progress in reducing risk. there are many ways to encourage natural hazard reduction or mitigation:  ensure the community understands and accepts its flood risk. invite non-traditional partners and community-based organizations that represent socially vulnerable populations to be part of the conversation educate the community about how mitigation can help their community in a way that is meaningful to them. provide technical assistance to help identify what mitigation makes sense. ensure the right stakeholders (community officials, local influencers, regional and state partners, etc.) are involved in the work, so that the decision-making required for mitigation action can be achieved. understand the community's other key concerns that might impact their interest and capacity and inform how best to engage with them. note: communication and outreach activities described in this task are meant to be supplemental or complementary efforts to those identified in the flood risk project mas. ctps and the fema region are responsible for confirming no duplication of effort in other awards (grants, cooperative agreements, interagency agreements, and contracts). unless otherwise amended in table 4. task 2 - strategic planning for community outreach and engagement in the \"custom scope elements\" cell, completion of strategic planning for community outreach and engagement task will include: awareness and action strategy - develop a regional approach to better understand communities' needs and priorities by conducting research on demographics and socio-economic factors, community communications practices and preferences, evaluation of local plans and initiatives, identification of local decision-makers and potential advocates, mitigation history and potential roadblocks, existing relationships with state and federal agencies, etc. these collected insights can build stronger partnerships within a community, increase participation in and acceptance of the mapping process, and personalize risk messaging and meeting approaches specifically for communities. this can be useful to identify any barriers or inequities in a community and help develop a more equitable approach to serve the whole community.  watershed and community assessment and mitigation action plan - assess a watershed and high priority communities to understand their mitigation priorities and their existing relationships with fema and other federal agencies to inform future outreach. the assessment may include local planners, floodplain administrators, elected officials, community leaders, local levee/dam/coastal leadership, business owners, residents, participants from other local departments such as public works, and others, based on local needs such as non-governmental organizations (ngos) or local initiatives. local hazard mitigation plans, fema's national risk index, the center for disease control /agency for toxic substances and disease registry's social vulnerability index along with other planning processes/documents can inform this work; supplemental interviews would also be informative.  relationship management plan - identify how to establish and/or build relationships between fema, the partner, and local stakeholders. consider the objectives, roles and responsibilities, and how you will measure success. lean on local organizations or community champions to understand the nuances of a community and ensure you are capturing all community dynamics. community prioritization - prioritize the action potential, action readiness, or need of communities within a watershed to inform project scoping and planning. consider marginalized communities or populations and how you might address any inequities when tailoring or providing services to close the equity gap. integration planning - help state, federal, and local partners coordinate efforts that move communities towards reducing flood risk. convene a variety of stakeholders (who might have diverse goals) and provide tools and knowledge to conduct joint mitigation planning in a watershed. consider a variety of planning tools, including those that address future conditions, and social vulnerability. the ctp will coordinate with their regional po to ensure up-to-date products and templates are used and new products are coordinated and fully reviewed prior to dissemination. meetings and process facilitation (if needed) intent: the ctp will hold meetings and facilitate the decision-making processes. meeting activities are only allowable if they are not funded under an award for a specific project area outlined in a flood risk project mas, or the ctp must provide additional scope to clarify the difference between the funding under the coms sow and the mas for the specific flood risk project. the following potential activities included in this task are listed below: process facilitation - support for implementation of the strategic planning efforts include: identifying and supporting key community priorities and key influencers; support community identification of mitigation opportunities; gap analysis of community requirements for mitigation implementation; ongoing relationship management; monitoring, evaluation, and update.  ctp will create materials in \"plain language\" to increase understanding for meeting participants.   where practical, ctps will strive towards applying accessibility principles in meetings such as ada accessibility and section 508 compliance.  all current policies on personally identifiable information regarding the allowed deliverables shall be followed.   the mapping partner shall notify fema and all applicable parties of all meetings with community officials at least 3 to 6 weeks prior to the meeting (with as much notice as possible). fema and/or its contractor(s) may or may not attend the community meetings. mitigation support intent: the ctp will leverage risk map data, analyses, products, and/or processes to support communities to advance mitigation actions. funds cannot be used to update all or part of a hazard mitigation plan but may be used to integrate hazard mitigation concepts into community plans and regulations.  the ctp shall work in close coordination with state and local emergency management offices throughout the life cycle of a risk map project to collect and quantify actions identified and actions advanced as part of a project specific mas. additionally, actions should be collected throughout the period of performance of this grant for any projects even after the close out of a risk map project. this activity is used to provide for the coordinated effort with local emergency management to communicate with communities outside of the life cycle of the risk map project, extending beyond completion of the project for all watersheds that fall within the period of performance of this sow. activities include: action identified - support for communities to identify mitigation opportunities and/or select alternatives through the provision of data and/or analysis. data is considered new data or aggregation of existing data that is delivered and disseminated in formats readily consumed by the end user. analysis (i.e., risk assessments; social vulnerability analysis; triple bottom line analysis; or feasibility assessments) will be performed to help identify solutions to identified problems and/or develop requirements for project solutions. there also is an opportunity to help the community understand its geographic location in the larger watershed and how the topography of the watershed should be considered in the selection of mitigation projects, given that one community's effort can have an impact downstream or upstream.  support will also include helping communities understand what capacity they need to undertake a project, how to organize their approach to project planning, how to engage the appropriate stakeholders to gain consensus around project options, and how to pursue funding sources to support the project. action advanced - support for communities to advance mitigation opportunities including scoping/design; budgeting; obtaining funding; project planning; technical support for zoning, code, and/or ordinance development. support will include helping communities navigate jurisdictional boundaries, political challenges related to gaining consensus and funding, support in navigating federal and state regulations and program requirements, identifying potential project partners, and educating the public about the benefit of the mitigation and any potential impacts that might occur during implementation.  evaluation and valuation - support provided to the community to evaluate and demonstrate the value of the mitigation investment, including calculating economic, environmental and/or social benefits as well as avoided losses from natural hazard events. other - other activities as negotiated with the fema region. communication and outreach to communities intent: the ctp will develop, promote and deliver resources and products to communities for risk awareness and mitigation action, such as developing messages and products to implement strategic outreach campaigns. activities include: materials development & dissemination to educate communities - develop and disseminate messages and materials that increase community understanding and awareness of both flood and other natural hazards and that support project work that is developing an updated assessment of community risk. materials include: plain language explanations of how flood risk is assessed and displayed in a regulatory product; how flood risk data can be used to inform community planning, why community feedback is critical to a flood risk project, updated website content, etc. consider needs of the community including translated or tailored materials, as needed.  materials development to help community officials in their own outreach - sample media materials to help promote a public meeting or explain project status, social media content and imagery for community officials to use, sample website copy, etc. provide guidance on the best strategies to engage a community based on the demographics, socioeconomic factors, and other elements that might improve engagement and understanding.  other - other activities as negotiated with the fema region. training and community capability development intent: develop and provide training to state and local officials throughout the course of a flood risk project (at the discretion of the regional office) that promotes awareness and mitigation action.  the ctp must ensure, and must provide documentation when requested by fema, that activities funded through this sow do not replace activities funded under other federal grant programs, such as hazard mitigation planning or floodplain management grant programs.  the recipient must identify if the training will be conducted by in-house staff or through contracted services. training can be provided at any time during a risk map project, and it may be beneficial to include a series of training activities over the course of a flood risk project. the ctp will coordinate and/or administer training for communities and/or individual groups. the ctp will: determine target audience. advertise to, and confirm training participants. determine training facility. deliver training. conduct training evaluations. follow-up with participants on unresolved issues. activities will include planning, developing, and delivering trainings or direct support in the areas of: benefit cost analysis (bca) - support communities to identify, capture, and document the necessary data

people and goods address one of the following research themes: identifying and addressing transportation-related barriers to economic opportunity for residents and businesses in region 2 informing the design of emerging mobility systems that serve the needs of diverse communities, residents, and businesses harnessing emerging analytical approaches to inform data-driven and equitable decision-making ensuring the physical resiliency of critical transportation infrastructures to support economic prosperity and resident quality of life identify intended outcomes and desired impacts. identify whether your proposed project is a continuation/expansion of current research or if it is new.   conflating open street map to other spatial networks (cosmos networks)  in this transformative project, avail will continue to develop its open-source methodology for conflating geo-spatial transportation networks to open street map with the aim to deploy an open-source solution for transportation practitioners across the nation. if successful this project will provide a necessary tool to transportation planners in the effort to align the nation's planning efforts around a shared basemap, which in turn, allows for the advanced development of open-source and proprietary tools for running data analyses and comparing disparate data sources. this project will make it easier to utilize emerging analytical approaches to inform data-driven and equitable decision making.  activitysim platform and other modeling efforts in this project avail will test, modify and deploy a web-based transportation modeling suite based on activitysim, an open-source software. avail will test the use of sumo, another open-source software, for network assignment of activitysim data. avail will compare v-sim and replica to activitysim, and if possible, validate activitysim generated model outputs to observed probe datasets (e.g., npmrds). a fully deployed open-source transportation model that utilizes open data could change the way modeling is conducted in the united states, by lower technical barriers and by providing model outputs that are comparable across regions. this project will make it easier to utilize emerging analytical approaches to inform data-driven and equitable decision making. avail can also explore developing new tools for approximating counts from synthpop/activitysim in conjunction with npmrds, continuous counts, and short counts. avail will continue to research the development of speed coefficients based on network attributes (e.g., signals, ramps, intersections) in an effort to create volume delay functions based on npmrds, continuous counts, and short counts.  landuse freight modeling  avail aims to collate a variety of best practices for parcel-based freight analysis and modeling. this advanced research project will transform freight analysis and decision making by creating tools for modeling parcel-based truck trip generation, and for mapping freight generation measures. the resulting tools will be tested in region 2 and avail will provide guidance on how to organize the appropriate data for analysis across the nation.  decision efficacy construct for interpreting and delivering equity in transportation projects (decide transportation projects). avail will continue developing tools for creating and analyzing equity measures based on travel time/cost to a variety of destinations. avail will utilize the mobility energy productivity measure (mep) methodology, developed by the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) to create equity measures based on travel time by mode, and by cost, for a variety of demographic and land-use data. the resulting web-based software can be utilized by transportation planners to perform equity cost-benefit analyses of projects, and prioritization and siting of projects.    resilient networks avail will advance its current research as a fema cooperating technical partner, to develop network resiliency measures, criticality measures and network vulnerability measures. this research will provide insights into how to better coordinate between transportation planning and hazard mitigation planning. it will support research flowing from the protect program in the iija federal transportation legislation. the spatial resources will support a wide range of spatial geographies, including providing sufficient granularity to assist in the planning of local culverts, bridge expansions or relocations, evacuation routing under a variety of extreme weather conditions, and assisting in long-range critical infrastructure planning.    proposed projects for the university at albany research team for the institute of mobility planning for agile and resilient transit (impart)  topic area: strategic implications of changing public transportation travel trends.  transit data science community of practice  dr. lawson and the avail team will develop a national transit data science community of practice (cop) based on their current efforts in new york state to evaluate and deploy open source transit tools for collaborative transit planning by mpos and transit agencies. avail will expand the new york state cop concept to the nation by holding regular software training webinars as part of a national transit technology transfer program. this community practice will identity value-add data products for use across the nation, such as transit accessibility measures, transit trips by road segment, and other equity analysis products that can be developed and deployed based on publicly available software and datasets. to support the cop will also be developing a new certificate in data-driven transportation planning to expand the master's in urban and regional planning transportation offerings and to serve the needs of the current transportation workforce across the state of new york and the nation.   transit trends in traffic  new york state department of transportation (nysdot) and the metropolitan planning organizations (mpos) in new york state formed a partnership with the university at albany visualization and informatics laboratory (avail) to develop a tool suite for the national performance management research dataset (npmrds).  the core data is provided by the federal highway administration (fhwa) and used to calculate the federally mandated performance measures (e.g., level of travel time reliability, truck travel time reliability, peak hours of excessive delay).  the core data uses traffic message channel (tmc) geographies (road segments) used to determine the time to traverse each segment.  avail developed an integrated, analytics platform that allows users to perform a wide-range of analyses using the data in a web-based, interactive environment (see https://npmrds.availabs.org/).  the npmrds has been enhanced with a larger network, conflated with nysdot��s data products (e.g., short counts and continuous counts data), and further conflated with openstreetmaps (osm).  gtfs is now being included across the state, making it possible to understand how transit operations are impacted by localized congestion, every 5 minutes.  research opportunities for advancing transit-dedicated analytics for medium-sized transit agencies (e.g., the capital district transit authority) would inform efficiencies for transit operations and provide understandings regarding interactions among automobiles, trucks, and transit vehicles in specific corridors.  additionally, integrating multi-modal flow data with new tools for visualizing socio-economic data at a variety of geographies, including census tracts, with 3d renderings (see https://www.capitalregionindicators.org/).  research on accessible tools for transit agencies to improve their planning and operations, and share insights with community members, stakeholders, and decision-makers, is a primary goal for impart to support research on strategic implications of changing public transportation travel trends.  multi-modal mid-trip mobility   recent advancements in data processing and techniques have accelerated access to, and analysis of, transit data streams, making it possible to evaluate efficiencies of transit operations (lawson, 2016).  for example, translation software designed to convert gtfs-r to siri in near real-time, generates a 30-second cache of the exact location of every transit vehicle in both the subway and the bus systems (lawson et al., 2019b). while the need for the translation software is to facilitate the use of code for app developers, the cached data opens new opportunities for understanding operations for planning purposes (instantaneous on-time-performance metrics).  at the same time, integrating traditional data sources used in transit planning (e.g., american community survey, census transportation planning products) with archived transit intelligent transportation systems (its) data, gtfs, and farebox data, facilitates bus ridership forecasting and visualizations to communicate operations to decision makers (lawson et al., 2019a).   the implementation of dashboards and business intelligence (bi) systems further moves transit operations towards more agile and responsive operations (lawson, 2020).  these techniques increase opportunities for integrating transit data streams with other modes (e.g., tncs, bicycles). integrated data streams make it possible to explore multi-modal mid-trip mobility (m4) options.  applications for m4 could include customer preferences or moving travelers out of transit vehicles that risk exposure due to potential contaminated conditions (e.g., covid-19), requiring re-routing of travelers.  in addition, making multi-options available offers operational efficiencies, along with near real-time occupancy rates and route demand.  for example, in communities where it is important to reduce the number of passengers to meet federal guidelines for social distancing, transit system planners need highly accurate stop-level demand information to accommodate the travel needs of essential workers, without increasing empty-seat miles or leaving passengers curbside.     lawson, c. t.

    "alex valm": "  recent imaging studies have revealed the highly organized structure that constitutes  supragingival dental plaque with extraordinary taxonomic resolution, including the conspicuous  abundance of filamentous organisms in the biofilm. changes in microbial community  composition and gene expression, called dysbiosis, that occur during the progression from  health through reversible gingivitis to chronic periodontitis have been elucidated with  metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. it is also well understood that a dynamic interplay  between microbiota and host immune system underlies the pathogenesis of inflammatory  periodontal diseases. what remains unknown is the importance of spatial proximity of specific  pathobiont microbes to host epithelial and immune cells in the initiation and progression of  periodontal disease and more generally how the structure of subgingival biofilms contributes to  the disease process. there exists a critical need to understand the role that biofilm architecture  plays in the periodontal disease process because while dental plaque is nucleated at, and  expands from the tooth surface, the host inflammatory responses occur in the gingival  epithelium, which may be tens to hundreds of microns from the enamel or root surface. to  address this knowledge gap, we will map the spatial structure of intact subgingival and  supragingival biofilms on extracted teeth associated with various stages of periodontal disease  as well as map the spatial distribution of specific microbial genes within the disease-promoting  biofilm. we will further image the intact plaque biofilm on teeth extracted from canine models of  periodontitis to identify structural similarities between model organism and human. we will use  this comparative, quantitative image analysis to test the hypothesis that conserved structural  features of the biofilm contribute to the progression of periodontal disease, especially through  the involvement of filamentous organisms, which, by nature of their extreme length and  geometric eccentricity, serve as scaffolds to bring inflammatory pathobiont organisms into close  contact with the gingival epithelium.     patients with periodontal disease have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (cvd); however, the molecular mechanism that links these diseases is yet to be definitively identified.  periodontal disease is mediated by a dysbiotic oral microbial community with defined spatial structure.  a number of putative oral probiotic organisms have been identified; however, their effect on the spatial structure of commensal and dysbiotic oral communities is yet to be elucidated because molecular sequencing-based approaches provide exhaustive lists of organisms and genes present in a community but little information on how these organisms are arranged in space.  the goal of the research proposed here is to address this fundamental knowledge gap with new technology to greatly expand the number of fluorophores that can be simultaneously distinguished in a single image of labeled microbes.  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) probes will be designed that target oral microbes previously identified in atherosclerotic plaques.  these probes and others will be used to map the spatial structure of in vitro oral biofilms grown from plaque donated by healthy volunteers. the physical interactions of human neutrophils with oral biofilms will be assayed using fluorescence imaging the effect of lipid mediators on phagocytic activity of nuetrophils activated by soluble biofilm factors will be evaluated.  biofilms will then be grown in the presence of oral probiotic organisms and the change in spatial structure will be observed using confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis.       project summary/abstract  the life science initiative and the rna institute of the state university of new york at albany (ualbany)  represent a regional hub for multidisciplinary and collaborative research by undergraduate and graduate  students, post-doctoral fellows, research staff, and faculty.  this highly interactive institution operates on a  dynamic collaborative approach toward scientific discoveries and high-quality education. to continue our  faculty’s historic interdisciplinary collaborative research ventures through our shared core research facilities,  we have identified an urgent need for a zeiss lsm 980 confocal microscope system with the latest airyscan 2  technology. this advanced quantitative fluorescence microscopy is    capable of fast image acquisition with  ultrahigh spatial resolution and multispectral imaging at high spectral resolution. acquisition of this advanced  imaging platform will facilitate a wide variety of research programs across our major and minor user groups  encompassing diverse fields including stem cell biology;  cell-cell communication in organ development;  neuronal development and behavior; microbial communities in human health; gene regulation and  transcriptional activation; epitranscriptomic regulation by viral infection, environmental,  and physical stress;  protein biosynthesis and translational regulation. the most advanced imaging systems currently available at  ualbany, the conventional confocal zeiss lsm710 fluorescence microscopy and two-photon fluorescence  microscope, lack sufficient resolution, sensitivity and speed to  support these multidisciplinary cutting-edge  research programs.  our major users,  in particular,  require the zeiss 980 superior resolution and imaging  capacity to answer critical research questions that are central to their research programs, including: 1)  understanding the interactions between niche cells and stem cell daughters responsible for cell differentiation;  2)defining the cell-cell and cell-ecm interactions that regulate   organ-formation and regeneration in disease; 3) understanding the development and regeneration of sensory neurons and gnrh-1 neurons in homeostasis and disease, and 4) defining systems level structure-function relationships in the oral microbiome. the imaging system is also critical to support the diverse research programs of our many minor users to acquir e multispectral data, high resolution images, and fast time-lapse images to  answer critical research questions. the  excellent upgrade capabilities of this system will enable our program’s major and minor users as well as the broader research community of new york’s capital region to meet the imaging research needs of their cutting-edge research programs. career: microbiome and host mucus biogeography as an integrated infection barrier in zebrafish  project summary overview microbes in nature frequently do not live as isolated monocultures, but rather, as highly diverse communities that form complex interaction webs. although dna sequencing provides an invaluable and exhaustive parts list of genes and organisms present in a community such as the vertebrate microbiome, this technology provides little to no information on how commensal microbes are arranged in their environments nor how they interact with the host on micron-level spatial scales to comprise a barrier to pathogen infection.  this five-year career-development plan is a comprehensive research, education and outreach program to address this fundamental knowledge gap.   research objectives develop novel machine learning computational algorithms to distinguish 20 or more different taxa of microbes in a sample. test the hypothesis that complex microbial communities interact in the zebrafish gut with each other and host to promote localized mucus production in the gut and systemic mucus production including on the skin surface. map the coordinated spatial distribution of mucus synthesis genes and in the host and mucin and carbohydrate metabolism genes in the microbiota on the micron scale. education objectives create a network of high school educators in upstate new york by exposing them to advancements in microbiome studies through an annual workshop and recruit educators and their students to participate in authentic computational microbiome image analyses. develop an innovative graduate/upper level undergraduate course module to equip life science students with scientific computing and quantitative tools that they can apply to their own research. launch a website on oral microbial community structure and assembly to serve as an interactive teaching tool and platform to disseminate algorithms to the broader scientific community. intellectual merit the spectral overlap of organic fluorophores precludes the use of more than a few different labels in any single experiment and is a general problem of fluorescence imaging.  development of the microbial spectral image analysis technology proposed here will increase the multiplexing capacity of microbial fish not incrementally, but by leaps and bounds.  larval zebrafish provide an opportunity to tease apart structure function relationships on the micron scale between host and microbiota due to their ease of manipulation (axenic models), optical transparency, and well characterized immune system development. the application of systems imaging studies to this model will transform the study of host tissue and microbiota networks and may produce paradigm shifts in our understanding of community structure and function.  the pi has broad training in cell biology, biophysics and scientific computing and has the skills to develop state-of-the-art spectral imaging algorithms and hypothesis testing. the pi has ongoing collaborations with leading investigators in the departments of biology and mathematics and rna institute at university at albany.  the new approaches proposed naturally extend a fertile line of research by the pi that has generated numbers of first- and senior-author publications in top ranked journals such as pnas (2011), nature (2017), journal of molecular biology (2019) and journal of dental research (2020). broader impacts that \"form fits function\" is a central tenet of biology, broadly applicable to many biological systems on many spatial scales from macromolecular complexes to cells, organs, organisms and ecosystems.  the technology and computational algorithms developed here will be broadly applicable to researchers in all fields of microbiology and cell biology.  the multi-disciplinary nature of the research, involving physics, biology, math and computer science, makes it particularly well-suited for educational purposes for a wide range of students.  importantly, the relationship between structure and function, the main research question to be addressed here, is a central concept of biology, taught early and readily grasped by young scholars.  the cutting-edge technology developed here as well as the ecological principles uncovered will enable, simultaneously, postdoctoral and graduate trainees as well as undergraduates and high school students to make authentic intellectual contributions to the field of microbial community structure and infection resistance, which are applicable to a broad range of animal hosts and environments.    abstract    according to the cdc, periodontitis affects 47.2% of individuals aged 30 and over. by the age of 65, the  number of people impacted by periodontitis jumps to 70.1%. dysbiosis, shifts in biofilm composition leading to  imbalances in microbial composition are precursors of widespread human diseases such as tooth decay  (dental caries) and periodontitis. how shifts in biofilm spatial structure impact the progression from health to  disease is unknown. we have developed an in vitro dental plaque culture system in which plaque samples  obtained from healthy donors via flossing are used to seed complex communities. quantitative analysis by  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), confocal microscopy, and spectral imaging demonstrated that model  biofilms are highly diverse, spatially structured, and unexpectedly heterogeneous in spatial structure. we  observed that the dental plaque inocula from healthy donors were composed of single cells and large  multispecies coaggregates. we hypothesize that early stochastic events mediated by these multispecies  coaggregates lead to highly spatially structured and heterogeneous biofilms depending on where these  interacting communities land on nascent surfaces. to test our hypothesis, we developed a protocol for  disrupting plaque coaggregates. we observed that biofilms derived from dental plaque inocula in which  aggregates were disrupted before seeding in vitro cultures resulted in biofilms with decreased diversity and  increased spatial homogeneity. biofilms derived de-aggregated plaque inocula lacked many gram-negative,  obligate anaerobe community members. our results demonstrate a previously unknown role multispecies  aggregates in structuring oral biofilms and may have clinical importance in the mouth.

    "deedee bennett": "project summary overview: the field of emergency management encompasses preparing for, responding to, mitigating the effects of, and recovery from large-scale natural and human-induced disasters, such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, major hurricanes and wildfires, and domestic and international terrorism. these events are reshaping how government agencies, private industry, and communities manage and process data and information, communicate and make decisions to prepare for, and build resilience to complex threats and hazards. not only does each disaster produce voluminous amounts of data for emergency managers to analyze and make critical decisions from, but it depends on an equally data-intensive backdrop of organizational and collaborative resources. furthermore, these events produce data rapidly and require highly skilled analysts to collect, analyze, validate, manage, visualize, and communicate information that will improve timely and accurate decision-making to protect lives, infrastructure, the essential systems that society relies on to function, as well as to ensure efficient use of scarce resources and equitable emergency efforts and outcomes. while the emergency management community is increasingly leveraging predictive analytic skills and tools to drive decisions, the profession still lacks sufficient numbers of dedicated, skilled data scientists that understand disasters and can apply practical data analytic solutions to the challenges that they pose. this project proposes the development of a disaster data science corps (d-dsc) to foster an innovative and technologically skilled emergency management workforce that can tackle 21st century challenges. by developing data science and analytics skills, future emergency managers, planners, first responders, and public health specialists will be able to take advantage of cutting-edge data analytics innovations to improve their ability to prepare for, respond to, mitigate, and recover from disaster events. the proposal incorporates harnessing the data revolution (hdr) by equipping student practitioners from a diverse set of backgrounds with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to become innovative, solutions-driven disaster data scientists capable not only of effectively deploying existing planned data streams, but also developing and adapting novel, situationally relevant ones. this project also aims to increase students' understanding of the complexities and ethical challenges of data science and how misinformation, disinformation, or misrepresentation of data can cause additional strain on the nation's capacity to respond to and recover from disasters.  intellectual merit: current government and private industry workforce studies indicate a significant shortage of skilled data scientists in all sectors, despite an increased reliance on big data and analytics to solve complex societal problems. the shortage in emergency management, a profession traditionally dominated by a relatively demographically homogeneous cadre in which former first responder leaders and military professionals (who advanced on the basis of other skill sets) loom large, is even more acute. furthermore, the emergency management profession has only recently started to adopt and prioritize data science positions at the local, state, and federal levels. the intellectual merit of the proposed project is to build a more technically skilled future emergency management workforce through the following objectives: 1) establish awareness about disaster data science among students within two- and four- year schools; 2) build student experience using data science tools and methods applied to disaster and emergency management problems; 3) engage students in the practice of data science via community research projects and experiential learning opportunities; and 4) empower students to be leaders in the development of ethical, rigorous, and community-centric data science for emergency management. broader impacts: successful completion of this project will transform the practice of emergency management by creating a pipeline to produce diverse cohorts of students capable of taking on leadership roles in disaster data science and related scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics (stem) disciplines. this proposal seeks to address the apparent workforce shortage and close this gap by creating opportunities for a diverse student cohort to engage in disaster data science experiential learning and accelerating the placement of skilled data scientists into the emergency management profession. the model we create will be one that can be readily and widely adopted by a range of higher education institutions and is flexible in terms of underlying institutional structures at collaborating schools as well as the nature and availability of partners for experiential learning opportunities.

is to use arm data to understand the npf process and its impact on ccn in different conditions (e.g., environment changes due to site locations and temporal changes at the sites). this will be done  through a combination of comprehensive data analysis and model simulations using the community model wrf-chem with explicit size-resolved particle microphysics. the scientific questions we propose to address are: what is the contribution of npf to ccn? what method or methods perform best for identifying the contribution of npf to ccn? what are the spatial, temporal, and environmental differences driving npf contribution to ccn? is wrf-chem able to simulate and further explain the npf and ccn observations on a regional scale? can discrepancies between wrf-chem and observations be used to improve model parameterizations of relevant processes (e.g., nucleation schemes)?  we propose to develop a harmonized data set of doe arm ccn and other  relevant observations (size distribution, aerosol chemistry, trace gases) to address these questions and serve as a resource to the wider modeling community.  this proposal is in response to de-foa-0002579 for data analysis and modeling

direct, $52,001 indirect project summary:  objectives: the improvement in air quality as a result of energy transitions has a surprising parallel trend in a rise in legionnaires' disease (ld) cases in the us.  we hypothesize that energy transitions improve air quality which increases the ph value of the aerosolized droplets from cooling towers (and other sources), enhancing the survival of legionella in these droplets and leading to an increase in ld. previous studies demonstrate that underserved communities are impacted more by ld. the objective of this project is to understand the association of air quality improvement with ld increase and to minimize potential negative impacts arising from energy transitions, especially to underserved communities.  approach: we propose a multi-faceted applied research program that integrates historical data analysis, field environmental sampling, laboratory validation studies, predictive model building, and a science-led outreach and education program for clinicians and residents of underserved vulnerable communities. we will (1) assess the impact of ph stress and desiccation on the survival rate of legionella ; (2) develop plume and 3-d models of legionella-contaminated water droplets  and study the impacts that air quality change has on legionella concentrations and ld risks in communities near cooling towers (major sources of ld) in new york state; (3) analyze two decades of us county level ld data and corresponding air quality data  to assess statistically the connection between air quality changes and ld increases in different regions; and (4) collaborate with local health departments and underserved communities to conduct ongoing ld risk monitoring and outreach and education activities, and to improve surveillance, clinical testing, quality of care, and outcomes.  expected results: this study will address priority research areas and major topics requested in this rfa (especially areas 1, 4, and 5). outputs and outcomes from this project include (1) new understanding, lab data, and models with regard to the impacts of improved air quality associated with energy transition on ld; (2) the development of intervention strategies, regulation recommendations, educational materials, and guidelines for underserved communities based on our research findings and will be developed in collaboration with underserved and high- risk communities and government partners. keywords: energy transitions, increase of legionnaires' disease, environmental justice, environmental risks,

microphysical and other processes controlling stratospheric aerosol size distributions and implications for chemistry and climate  abstract stratospheric aerosol particles are important for the chemical and radiative balance of the atmosphere. changes in their concentrations, spatiotemporal distribution, and physicochemical properties have implications such as surface cooling, precipitation, and the destruction of ozone. the largest sources of stratospheric aerosols are large volcanic eruptions and anthropogenic activities. there may be anthropogenic impacts through solar radiation modification/management approaches in the near future. it is imperative to address the large uncertainty remaining in current models around stratospheric aerosols toward understanding their roles in climate and chemistry. a key source of this uncertainty stems from the representation of microphysics of stratospheric aerosols. the large disparities in modeling stratospheric global mean aerosol optical depth in response to volcanic forcing have been identified to be mainly due to differences in aerosol size. model-observation comparisons show that the persistence (or e-folding time) of the sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere are not reproduced by global aerosol microphysics models. in the stratospheric environment, suitable conditions for nucleation (in situ formation of aerosols from gases nucleation), enhanced effect of charges on coagulation and growth, and longer aerosol lifetime exist. these have not yet been fully considered in existing models and calls into question the reliability of global aerosol models for assessing future scenarios. the goal of the proposed project is toward addressing this critical knowledge gap in the evolution of the atmospheric particle size distributions (psds), by studying the determining microphysical and dynamic processes and assessing the consequent chemistry and climate response to volcanic and anthropogenic forcings. it is hypothesized that the microphysical processes of nucleation and charge effects on growth and coagulation are important for stratospheric psds and consequently for model-observation concordance in optical and chemical properties. a global atmospheric chemistry model with composition- and size-resolved aerosol microphysics will be assessed against measurements to test this hypothesis. the large differences in modeled stratosphere-troposphere exchanges (ste) important for stratospheric aerosol abundances and psds will be investigated for spatiotemporal differences and size- and composition-effects with respect to measurements. the effect of processes directly injecting particles and their precursors into the stratosphere will be examined. long-term (1979-2022) size-resolved stratospheric aerosols and key properties of stratospheric aerosols (size distributions, surface area, and optical properties), their additional impacts on tropospheric composition, and their implications for stratospheric ozone will be modeled and compared with measurements. a suite of aura and a-train satellite, nasa aircraft, ozonesonde, and ground-based measurements for aerosols, their sources, their precursors, their properties, and parameters they affect, will be analyzed, and used for model constraints and model evaluation. this project is expected to provide rich insights into the causal mechanisms, long-term atmospheric composition trends and changes, and chemical composition and transport impacts on stratospheric ozone and is relevant for aurast/acmap priorities. it will rigorously develop new understanding of key microphysical processes and their impacts on stratospheric aerosols through linkages between microphysical modeling, global atmospheric chemistry modeling, and analysis and interpretation of nasa satellite and aircraft measurements. these will improve our understanding of the earth system and contribute to more robust assessments of climate change and risk analysis of solar radiation management.

customs, and border security operations and measures, in accordance with the dataset and exbs pillars prescribed within the country collection form (the \"scorecard\" - attached as an appendix). cpr experts will use a combination of open-source research and data collection, as well conduct a two-week, in-country visit to conduct meetings and interviews with goe officials to meet the following project objectives:  to populate and score all 104 questions on the country collection form (the \"scorecard\") based on project research, data collection and findings. to draft an accompanying narrative report that will articulate the following: egypt's existing stc-related system including: relevant laws and regulations, control lists, licensing processes, outreach to industry, stc enforcement, and interagency and international cooperation on stc-related matters (exbs pillar 1 - strategic trade management) egypt's customs enforcement measures including: customs targeting, inspection/detection, and investigative capabilities (exbs pillar 2 - customs enforcement)  egypt's border security operations, including: threat identification and mitigation capabilities (exbs pillar 3 - border security operations)  scope of work to implement the project goals and objectives center for policy research (cpr) research fellows will engage in the following major activities to realize the project's goals: the cpr project team will remain in communication with isn/ecc and the relevant action officers throughout the project, conducting a project kickoff meeting after the new award is received, submitting a project implementation plan, and submitting quarterly reports and after-action reports. cpr will conduct open-source research and analysis in advance of visiting egypt to assess the goe's existing stc, customs, and border security laws, regulations, institutions, procedures, and implementation. cpr will endeavor to gather as much information in advance of the in-country meetings as possible, understanding that some of this information will not be available in the open-source. the open-source research will help to shape the interview questions and ensure that outstanding data is obtained during the in-person meetings.   cpr experts will travel to egypt to hold two-weeks of meetings, interviews, and conduct on-site visits to learn more about the goe's strategic trade control, customs, and border security operations, populate the scorecard, and obtain other information and data necessary to complete the narrative report. cpr will coordinate with the program officers in identifying dates for the in-country visit and then will make the requisite logistical requirements to travel to egypt. this will include making all necessary arrangements for 2 cpr project team members to travel to egypt and conduct meetings and on-site visits throughout egypt. in the first week, cpr experts intend to hold meetings in cairo with relevant government agencies and bodies. in the second week, cpr experts will travel to various points of egress (poe) and border crossings throughout egypt (in coordination with isn/ecc and u.s. embassy-egypt) to gather additional information and firsthand insights into existing customs and border security measures in egypt.  estimated outputs and indicators of success  the immediate indicator of success for this project can be evaluated in terms of whether the cpr team is able to successfully obtain all requisite information necessary to complete the scorecard and the accompanying narrative report. cpr will endeavor to gather as much information in advance of the in-country meetings as possible, understanding that some of this information will not be available in the open-source. the open-source research will help to shape the interviews and in-the-field questions and ensure that outstanding data can be obtained during the in-person meetings and on-site visits. a medium-term measure of success can be observed if the scorecard and narrative report can effectively identify existing deficiencies in egypt's stc, customs, and border security systems and illustrate how such gaps can potentially be remedied through additional isn/ecc support and technical assistance.  longer term, the report and completed scorecard should contribute to isn/ecc's strategic goals of assisting the goe in creating national stc, customs, and border security systems that are aligned with international standards and best practices and which can serve to prevent dangerous proliferation-sensitive transactions and activities in egypt.     scope of work for loe 2 goals and objectives:   this project's goal is to help prevent the proliferation of wmd, missiles, and destabilizing conventional weapons and

    "oliver elison timm": "  abstract   the greater pacific islands region, encompassing over 300,000 square miles of land and millions  of square miles of ocean, has historically experienced a high burden of climate disasters such as  tropical cyclones, drought, wildfire, flooding, and sea level rise, with well-documented impacts  on food and water security, human health and safety, infrastructure, ecosystem health, and  geopolitical stability. physical, political, and social factors directly contribute to how different  island communities and jurisdictions experience, prepare for, and respond to these impacts,  and – as the covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated – the effects of compound events can have  disproportionate impacts on populations that have been made more vulnerable. understanding  the risks and vulnerabilities of different communities, organizations, and infrastructure across  the region is still a critical issue for prioritizing and funding climate adaptation projects, which  means that the impacts of compound and correlated extreme events and the ways they amplify  across different stakeholders must be better characterized.  the proposed pacific regional integrated sciences and assessments (risa) phase iv project  portfolio addresses the overarching question: how can we support and develop sustainable,  equitable, and just climate solutions that increase pacific island resilience to compounding  disasters and extreme events? project objectives are integrated and build off of progress the  pacific risa has made for over a decade, as we 1) conduct baseline evaluative research to  identify factors that inhibit equitable climate adaptation and integrate those metrics  programmatically; 2) identify technical linkages between existing data, models, and projections  for hawaiʻi and the us-affiliated pacific islands (usapi), such as the hydrological modeling and  downscaling products that were developed during pacific risa phase iii; 3) utilize those inputs  to inform adaptation strategies and costs through the generation of extreme scenarios of  overlapping vulnerabilities and hazards; and 4) coordinate peer-to-peer exchanges across  sectors and regions to enhance the scalability and transferability of project outputs.  underpinning all projects are commitments to environmental and climate justice, transparency,  and the inclusion of vulnerable communities. tracking these objectives will be the focus of  ongoing and iterative program evaluation. a dedicated program manager will integrate the  efforts of staff and pis, and liaise with our partners and other regional climate programs. the  sustained assessment specialist position will support the us national climate assessment  (nca) and, beginning with the findings of the recent pacific islands regional climate  assessment (pirca) reports, identify specific sectors or outcomes for in-depth regional  assessments. the small grants competition will partner with the noaa education and outreach  specialist to better meet the need for climate education in hawai‘i’s formal k-12 curriculum.  this proposal addresses several of the most important climate-sensitive management  challenges that have been identified through regional climate assessments and nca3 and 4,  while integrating multiple regional hazards and societal issues. these include compounding  threats to physical, socioeconomic, and cultural systems; economic recovery from disasters and  enhanced solutions for environmental security; and coastal flooding and vulnerability  assessments. the suite of interconnected projects also responds to three of the four priority  areas outlined in the ffo, specifically coastal inundation, water resources, and marine  resources. special relevance to csi and risa priorities is reflected in the commitment to  actionable climate research and equitable knowledge transfer that support decision-making   throughout hawai‘i and the us-affiliated pacific. as a result of being a trusted boundary  organization and source of information for the past decade, in phase iv the pacific risa is well  positioned to expand as a hub for implementation through actionable science.

boundary  layer (pbl) for transport of pollutants/carbon/aerosol and water vapor, wind energy, cloud  dynamics and convection, and large-scale circulation.” approaches to deriving 3d winds  are   suggested   that   combine   measurements   from   doppler   wind   lidar,   microwave,  scatterometer, and ir hyperspectral instruments.     in three previous nasa roses awards under the “the science of terra and aqua”  (nnx11ae97g, nnx14ai77g, 80nssc18k0984), we developed a 3d winds product by  tracking  moisture  features  (troposphere)  and  ozone  gradients  (stratosphere) from  airs  retrieved vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, and ozone. evaluation of the impact of  these observations in the nasa gmao geos-5 model are encouraging.     recently, the airs feature tracking algorithm was adapted for use with cris and atms  on  suomi  npp  and  noaa-20.  this  results  in  clear  sky  atmospheric  motion  vectors  (amv)  from  the  hyperspectral  ir  and  all-weather  amvs  from  the  microwave.  by  also  incorporating  the  viirs  cloud-tracked  winds,  we  propose  to  create  a  blended  3d  winds  product  from  viirs/cris/atms.  we  will  continue  using  machine  learning  techniques  developed  at  jpl  to  produce  robust  estimates  of  the  uncertainty  in  the  new  3d  wind  retrievals. the current wind products are generated independently in near real-time, so this  proposal is in response to sec. 2.3 “new data products” to continue producing those  products and to develop a blended product for applications and assimilation.     these products are being produced routinely at the university of wisconsin-madison, and  the maturity and validation of each of the products is at different stages. the goal of this  project  is  to  advance  the  three  products  to  the  same  level  of  maturity  and  blend  them  through a new quality control scheme, facilitated by jpl’s characterization of the wind  retrievals  in  terms  of  uncertainty  and  information  content  both  spatially  as  well  as  vertically. this will result in the most comprehensive and quantified satellite-derived all- weather 3d winds product extending from the lower stratosphere and into the pbl.     the proposed 3d winds product will benefit the investigation of high-latitude dynamical  systems  and  coupled  stratosphere-troposphere  processes.  the  tropopause-level  wind  products will be used to investigate the stratospheric polar vortex interaction with, or effect  on, tropopause polar vortices, the position of the tropospheric extratropical jet and the role  of  rossby  wave  breaking  in  the  evolution  of  the  jet.  the  addition  of  tracking  humidity  features from microwave retrievals will provide a first-ever attempt to infer atmospheric   2  3d winds into the stratosphere and pbl. roses 2020 a.33 sec. 2.3  motion in the pbl using passive remote sensing, benefiting the analysis of the development  and maintenance of long-lived tropopause polar vortices.    this  effort  will  improve  our  understanding  of  the  processes  involved  in  troposphere- stratosphere  coupling  and  pbl  wind  structure  when  evaluated  by  assimilating  into  the  gmao geos-5 model. in addition, the winds product could be useful for planning future  missions  using  constellations  of  small  satellites  by  informing  expected  spatial  coverage,  vertical distribution, error characterization, and model impact of 3d winds. these products  could contribute to the decadal survey need to decrease the uncertainty in the stratospheric  initial state with the goal of improving subseasonal to seasonal forecasts.       an evaluation and assessment of biases and systematic errors of stratospheric variability  and troposphere-stratosphere coupling in s2s prediction    abstract  the atmospheric variability in the stratosphere, located 10–50 km above earth’s surface,  generally occurs on timescales considered longer than weather timescales but shorter than climate.  this  stratospheric  variability  occurs  in  locations  from  the  tropics  to  the  high-latitudes,  and  can  impact weather and climate at earth’s surface on timescales of weeks to decades. the uncertainty,  biases, and errors in resolving stratospheric variability in a forecast model are largely due to the  fact  that  most  types  of  stratospheric  variability  are  associated  with  troposphere-stratosphere  rossby  wave  coupling.  the  nature  of  the  rossby  waves  is  largely  determined  by  the  vertical  profiles of wind and temperature, so that during periods of troposphere-stratosphere coupling we  have to not only resolve these variables but their vertical derivatives for the skillful prediction of  the troposphere-stratosphere coupling.   this  project  will  use  a  process-based  understanding  to  evaluate  and  assess  stratospheric  variability  and  troposphere-stratosphere  coupling  in  the  new  suite  of  models  available  within  noaa.  to  date,  there  are  several  slated  for  inclusion  in  the  enhanced  model  evaluation  tools  (metplus). this project would contribute additional new operationally relevant diagnostics that  include  real-time  and  retrospective forecast  analyses  of  the  vertical  structure  of  the  zonal  wind,  temperature,  wave  amplitudes,  meridional  eddy  heat  flux and wave  activity  flux,  and  eddy  geopotential. these diagnostics would be used to assess the process-based (related to rossby wave  dynamics, blocking, cyclone/storm track) mechanism of hits, misses, and false alarms, as well as  an  evaluation  and  assessment  of  the  uncertainty,  biases,  and  systematic  errors  of  stratospheric  variability and troposphere-stratosphere coupling in the reforecast periods available for the sfsv1,  via  the  s2sp5..  an  outcome  of  this  project  would  be  a  real-time  website  to  evaluate  these  stratosphere diagnostics.  the proposed research is submitted as a  focus area b proposal to the climate program  office's fy2022 federal funding opportunity, specifically the “oar/cpo/cvp-nws/osti/  modeling division - joint competition to advance process understanding and representation of  precipitation in models.” this research contributes to cvp and osti’s goals of understanding,  diagnosing,  and  modeling  of  key  processes  for  improving the  simulation  s2s  precipitation  in  weather and climate models by focusing on stratospheric variability, a known contributor to s2s  variability. this research will provide noaa with an assessment on their models’ ability to  resolve  stratospheric  variability  in  a  forecast,  which  can  provide  situational  awareness  of  interpreting future forecasts in real-time. in addition, this proposed work would contribute to the  stratosphere sub-project  of the wcrp/wwrp s2s prediction project and will be conducted in  collaboration with the ufs r2o teams.             in the last several years, north america observed several occurrences of extreme cold temperatures for  days-long periods that have had both economic and societal impacts and have even led to fatalities.  meteorologically, the mechanisms surrounding these extreme cold air events within the troposphere  (lower atmosphere) are understood. however, in recent decades, the atmospheric science community  has established that stratospheric (upper atmospheric) variability can have vast meteorological  implications on surface temperatures as well. this stratospheric variability may give us additional lead- time in identifying the risk for extreme winter weather.    the proposed research examines the patterns and responses of continental us (conus) temperature to  stratospheric variability at subseaonal-to-seasonal (s2s; 2-weeks to 2-months) timescales. the methods  are novel because rather than using latitudinally averaged metrics of the stratospheric flow, the impacts  of the geometric variability of the stratospheric polar vortex on temperature will be the focus the  project. first, the project will build a climatology to understand the variability of geometric properties of  the stratospheric vortex. then, the relationship of these geometric metrics with temperature will be  assessed.  finally, we’ll quantify our ability to resolve the geometric vortex variability in s2s models and  their ability to reliably capture the relationship established in the climatological analysis.     the results of this research project can potentially be a tool for improving modeling technologies within  the nasa gmao s2s forecasts. understanding and diagnosing the role of the prescribed elliptical  behavior and diagnostics, using composite reanalysis and observational data, will improve our  understanding of stratospheric dynamics and predictability within a polar centric sphere. the proposed  research contributes to closing a research gap in forecasting stratospheric behavior in relation to winter- time extremes and is directly applicable to the research program. additionally, the outcomes from this  research could supplement the images, data, and information available on the already popular nasa  ozone watch webpage managed by nasa/gsfc (e.g.,  https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/meteorology/nh.html).      abstract    since the stratospheric circulation evolves more slowly than the troposphere below it, it  can have impacts on the subseasonal to seasonal variability of weather in the troposphere. a  recent synthesis of the literature shows that the stratospheric circulation can play a large role in  high-impact weather events, including cold air outbreaks and extreme heat, air pollution,  wildfires, wind extremes, and storm clusters, as well as changes in tropical cyclones and sea ice  cover, and they can have devastating consequences for human health, infrastructure, and  ecosystem. with millions of dollars in economic losses associated with these extreme events,  understanding and assessing the factors that contribute to reliable and usable forecasts of these  events is a critical need. in examining these events, we need to consider that the troposphere and  stratosphere communicate intermittently with dramatic consequences via troposphere- stratosphere dynamic wave coupling.   the proposed research is motivated by literature from the weather and climate forecasting  communities, where it is largely accepted that including a well-resolved stratosphere results in  improved model forecast skill at s2s timescales. during troposphere-stratosphere wave  coupling, the dispersive nature of waves means they can be transmitted, absorbed, reflected, or  refracted (or some combination of the former) in three dimensions contingent on their  wavenumber. the proposed research considers the three-dimensional rossby wave dynamics in  the tropopause and stratosphere by evaluating these dynamics during periods when they are  known to be important, during periods of extreme cool-season weather. the nature of wave  propagation across the tropopause is determined by the rossby wave index of refraction, which  is largely a function of the horizontal and vertical derivatives of the wind field. the idea that the  role of three-dimensional wave propagation is key to resolving these troposphere-stratosphere  coupling events at long lead times and that we have initial conditions errors in the region where  this three-dimensional wave dynamics the important is a motivation for this proposed project.    this proposal targets the weeks 3-4/s2s priority area, specifically 1c: advances in  verification & validation by identifying and reducing model deficiencies in representing key  sources of predictability on weather and s2s timescales due to stratosphere-troposphere coupling  and quasi-biennial oscillation (qbo). by comparing a unique 3d winds product to the initial  conditions of wind and other relevant fields from s2s prototype runs, the proposed analysis will  identify and quantify the uncertainties and potential biases in forecasts of stratosphere- troposphere dynamics and resulting high-impact weather events on s2s timescales. and,  depending on the results of the evaluation, we would perform additional model sensitivity  experiments by assimilating the 3d winds.   this final combined winds product will be at rl 7, which not only positions it for  assimilating and testing in the ufs and gfs, but also is a first step for future incorporation into  the operational ncep models. moreover, the winds teams at cimss have a long history of  collaborating with noaa in r2o activities of transitioning research products into nesdis  operations.

    "mustafa aksoy": "automating radio frequency interference detection in microwave radiometry  this proposal, written by the future investigator, imara mohamed nazar, a phd student in the department of electrical and computer engineering at university at albany, aims to develop advanced radio frequency interference (rfi) detection algorithms to be implemented in passive microwave remote sensing instruments.  state of the art rfi detection and mitigation algorithms implemented in microwave radiometers rely on the fact that certain properties of human made interference signals differ from those of natural thermal radiations in a particular domain such as time and frequency. thus, rfi contaminated measurements can be detected using thresholds applied in that domain. however, it has been observed that such single domain approaches are not efficient enough to detect and remove rfi in case the interference does not follow this simple assumption and cannot be distinguished from natural emissions in one domain. to overcome this problem, this project will develop intelligent machine learning algorithms which will operate in multiple domains simultaneously to identify interference contaminated radiometer measurements.  a 3-year research is proposed. in the first year, radiometer datasets will be collected, simulated and analyzed to characterize rfi signals. second and third years will include the development of the new rfi detection algorithms using various machine learning techniques and their performance analyses.    global environmental monitoring system temporal observation research mission (gem-storm) severe mesoscale weather events, including dissipating and active hurricanes, tornadic supercell events, and convective precipitation, cause billions in annual damage within the us, extensive loss of life, and widespread business disruption. these impacts occur globally with even larger costs and are expected to worsen in variability and impact in response to climate change. prediction of such severe mesoscale weather is currently limited by the extreme undersampling of atmospheric temperature, humidity, clouds, and precipitation state underneath cloud tops that obscure infrared or optical sensors, or, are severely time-undersampled by the few available operational passive microwave sensors that can observe through clouds. the global environmental monitoring system temporal observation research mission (gem-storm) will provide a first demonstration of short-term (0.5-12 hour) mesoscale weather forecast improvements using global observations at key passive microwave sensing bands that provide information on these variables under all weather conditions, and at observation intervals appropriate for the correlation times of these processes.  the mission will be accomplished using a constellation of 48 low-earth orbiting 6u passive microwave cubesat satellites with sounding and imaging channels at the 118.7503 ghz o2 and 183.310 ghz h2o bands. the constellation would be based on the global environmental monitoring system (gems) small satellite passive microwave sensor technology that has been demonstrated to trl7 by orbital microwave systems, inc. the gem-storm ground segment will provide minute-scale latency on gems satellite observations to assimilated forecast products over a limited region (conus) using a network of x-band ground stations provided by raytheon intelligence and space, inc. using gem-storm data the short-term predictability of mesoscale weather systems using time-resolved passive microwave observations would be evaluated for the first time. the achievement of 15-minute sampling and latency is essential to maintaining coherent and locked tracking of state variables in numerical weather forecast models.  gem-storm science will leverage rapid radiative transfer modelling and all-weather radiance assimilation technology being developed by oms, cu boulder, and the university of wisconsin cimss under the support of the u.s air force. all-weather assimilation of satellite data will be accomplished using a state-dependent extended kalman filter (xkf) assimilation system that is locked onto evolving cloud and precipitation systems using data obtained within the coherence time of convective and non-convective cloud and precipitation signatures. additional science team partners will include personnel from the ncar, whose focus will be on hurricane forecasting using gem-storm, the nasa/gsfc's gpm science team, and suny albany, who will contribute to the on-orbit constellation calibration.  the gem-storm constellation will uniquely benefit from the large number of coincident observations at crossings that will provide the first-ever massive daily microwave cross-calibration data set. deployment of the gem-storm constellation will use a launch service provider that will be down selected from one of three orbit-optimized and low-risk options. a minimum 3-year long mission segment, including a minimum one year window with full constellation science operations, will be provided by raytheon. all mission costs, including satellite, sensors, launch, communications, mission operations, and mission science are included within the evm-3 cost cap which supports the six-year project. in addition, gem-storm will support global direct data broadcast to provide self-funded participation by collaborating international partners to use gem-storm high temporal resolution data within their own regions of interest. the project will include evaluation of constellation data in global forecast models through both noaa and ecmwf.  objectives the objective of the proposed work is to mature the development of a 1-10 ghz passive microwave radiometer (arrow) from technology readiness level (trl) 4 to trl 6. the instrument will be used to characterize the subsurface geophysical properties within the top 10 meters of the lunar regolith and to infer the presence of possible subsurface layers of ice near the lunar poles. the focus of the work is the development of the critical components of the radiometer [sensing antenna and radio frequency (rf) subsystem] for an astronaut-deployed instrument that is adaptable to a lander or orbital platform. arrow will measure upwelling microwave brightness temperature in the 1-10 ghz range at 300 mhz steps. brightness temperature is sensitive to the vertical profile of varying physical temperature and dielectric properties, which are related to a number of regolith characteristics, including thickness, layering, density structure, thermal and other physical properties. thus, by combining brightness temperature measured from our instrument with advanced geophysical models that our team has developed, we can constrain bulk subsurface regolith properties. arrow's frequency range and continuous spectral coverage will also be able to infer bulk properties at depth intervals ranging from approximately 0.5 m to 10 m.  methods we will achieve our objectives through a series of engineering tasks to design, build and test the instrument and raise the trl of the current design from 4 to 6. the tasks will be divided into the components and steps to evaluate the sensing system, including: (1) rf front end, (2) rf back end, (3) antenna, (4) systems integration, (5) testing in the simulated lunar environment. our final deliverable will be a complete rf and antenna system that will be subjected to a number of performance and environmental tests appropriate for trl 6. testing includes: sensitivity and uniformity of the measurements, stability and repeatability of the calibrations over varying temperatures in thermal-vac, and effect of lunar dust simulant on the antenna's rf response. to refine instrument requirements and evaluate performance for addressing regolith science questions, we will conduct a number of modeled simulations of brightness temperature assuming a range of parameters relevant to the lunar environment.  perceived significance this proposed work and the arrow instrument concept is relevant to the dali call, as it is well aligned with the objectives \"…to develop new technologies that significantly improve instrument measurement capabilities for lunar science missions.\" arrow will help to answer high-priority lunar science questions (e.g., artemis science objectives, leag reports) related to shallow subsurface regolith properties, and address strategic knowledge gaps for in situ resource utilization (isru), including the bulk geotechnical properties of the regolith and possible presence of layers of water ice near the poles. arrow will be adaptable to a number of mission concepts, including as an astronaut-deployed package and as a payload on a commercial lander or orbital platform. the subsurface regolith observations enabled by arrow would bridge an important measurement gap between the abundance of very near surface (microns to centimeters) measurements from short-wavelength visible to thermal infrared instruments and deeper (tens of meters to many kilometers) geophysical measurements such as seismic, gravity, and radar sounders. landed, meter-scale spatial measurements of lunar microwave brightness temperature over a broad frequency range have not been previously conducted. such landed measurements will provide an important ground-truth for the current low spatial resolution (tens of kilometers) chang'e-1,2 orbital measurements of microwave brightness temperature at the moon.    career: enabling the next generation wideband microwave radiometers for the  remote sensing of the cryosphere    overview:  microwave  penetration  depths  in  ice  have  been  reported  to  vary  with  frequency,  thus,  wideband  microwave  radiometers  can  be  used  to measure  thermal  and  physical  properties  of  the  cryosphere  as  a  function of depth which allows characterization of past and current climate of earth, along with sea and  land ice dynamics and mass balance.  utilizing   wideband   microwave   radiometers   to   observe the   cryosphere   requires   (1)   electrical  characterization  of  ice  across  wide  frequency  and  temperature  ranges,  and  (2)  development  of  effective  radio  frequency  interference  (rfi)  detection  and  mitigation  algorithms  which  would  allow  these  instruments to operate in the unprotected and densely occupied radio spectrum.  therefore,  the  overarching  goal  of  this  career  development  project  is  to  enable  such  next-generation  wideband  microwave  radiometers  for  the  remote  sensing  of  the  cryosphere  by  addressing  these  two  challenges, besides training of the project pi, dr. aksoy, as a prominent scientist-educator in the field of  microwave remote sensing. in pursuit of this goal, the specific objectives of the project are:  (1)  electrical  characterization  of  ice  across  wide frequency  (0-50  ghz)  and  temperature  (200-273  k)  ranges by measuring its complex permittivity.  (2)  validation  of  the  measured  ice  permittivity  values  by  comparing  simulated  brightness  temperatures  generated using those values to data provided by the polar-orbiting space-borne microwave radiometers.  (3) development of multi-dimensional, machine  learning based rfi detection and mitigation algorithms  for microwave  radiometers to minimize errors in measurements  collected  within densely occupied  radio  spectrum shared by active services.  (4) validation of the developed rfi detection and mitigation techniques as well as the revealed scientific  knowledge regarding the electrical characterization of ice using a digital wideband radiometer prototype.  (5) integration of the proposed research activities into the courses dr. aksoy teaches and supervises in the  electrical  and  computer  engineering  (ece)  department  at  ualbany  to  train  the  new  generation  of  engineers and scientists, including the pi himself, to advance microwave technologies for the cryosphere  studies in accordance with the mission of the department, “science in service to society.”    intellectual merit:   the  project  aims  to  create  a  complex  permittivity  dataset  for  ice  and  snow  across  an  unprecedentedly  wide temperature and frequency ranges which will open the door for various remote sensing designs and  missions.  thus,  a  completely  new  scientific  information  will  be  revealed  to  the  cryosphere  science  community. moreover, if successfully completed, this project would revolutionize the rfi detection and  mitigation  in  passive  microwave  remote  sensing  of  the  cryosphere  by  employing  modern  machine  learning  techniques.  these  multi-dimensional  algorithms  can  be  implemented  in  the  new  generation  of  radiometers equipped with capable digital backends  and processors, and  have the  potential to efficiently  eliminate even low level rfi. thus, the radiometers will be able to operate in the unprotected portions of  the  microwave  spectrum  as  well,  which  will  increase  the  bandwidth of  the  measurements  and  provide  lower uncertainties and higher vertical resolution.    broader impacts:  the project results  will have  considerable  scientific  impacts  as  the  proposed investigation directly helps  the  international  efforts  to  obtain  information  from  the  polar  regions  regarding  the  earth  system  while  minimizing the human footprint in these vulnerable parts of our planet. furthermore, the experience and  knowledge  gained  with  this  project  will  be  used  in  other  earth  and  planetary  studies,  to  serve even  a   larger science community. for instance, similar complex permittivity measurements can be performed to  characterize  planetary  samples  expected  to  be  brought  with  the  artemis  mission,  and  the  novel  rfi  detection and mitigation algorithms can be implemented in earth observing radiometers measuring other  observables  such  as  precipitation,  soil  moisture,  atmospheric  and  sea  surface  temperatures,  and  ocean  salinity, all mentioned in the most recent decadal survey by the national academies titled “thriving on  our changing planet: a decadal strategy for earth observation from space.”    enabling low-power smart sensors with machine learning calibration  microwave radiometry is a powerful tool in remote sensing and is used often in nasa space missions from monitoring earth's climate to exploring the chemistry of exoplanets and atmospheres in our solar system. many if not most microwave radiometers are designed to remain powered during operations. continuous operation facilitates calibration by reducing the influence of a receiver's transient response on the sensor's measurement uncertainty. however, available spacecraft power and/or thermal requirements can lead to the need for power cycling a radiometer. turning power off to an instrument stops its data acquisition but also leads to a loss of data when the instrument is powered back on until its electronics are sufficiently stable to make a calibrated measurement. rapid power cycling can also be used to reduce the average power draw of the instrument, while providing near-continuous data to the cost of increased measurement uncertainty. this project aims to develop an intelligent calibration algorithm that draws upon the ability of neural networks to learn and utilize the characteristics of a sensor's transient response to produce calibrated measurements with minimum uncertainty.  agile radiometer for regolith observations using microwaves (arrow)  objectives the objective of the proposed

    "sujata murty": "  project summary  overview: coral proxy records from existing red sea cores will be used to reconstruct monthly-resolved  and season-specific hydrologic variability to understand the drivers of deep water ventilation and circulation  in the red sea. specifically, the proposed work will use measurements of sr/ca and δ 18 o in coral skeleton  to reconstruct seasonal to multi-decadal records of sea surface salinity (sss) and temperature (sst) in the  red  sea over  the  past three centuries.  links  between red  sea  ventilation and regional atmospheric  and  surface ocean properties over the past centuries will be evaluated using observational/reanalysis products  and instrumental  climate  indices.  linkages  between  the long-term spatio-temporal  perspective  of deep  water ventilation and regional climate phenomena (e.g. arctic oscillation, north atlantic oscillation) will  be  examined,  utilizing  comparisons  of  coral  proxy  records  spanning  6º  latitude in the  red  sea. these  records of red sea variability extending back nearly 300 years will constrain variability during periods of  sustained warm and cold  climate, providing a more robust test of the hypothesis linking large-scale climate  system behavior with deep water ventilation.    intellectual merit: the sustainability of the global overturning circulation is a fundamental factor for the  earth’s climatic stability. at present our understanding of the drivers of past changes in circulation and  thermohaline transport within the under-observed indian ocean and connected marginal seas is incomplete,  limiting  our  ability  to  accurately  forecast  regional  climate  impacts  at  various  timescales.  improving  our  understanding  of the  drivers  of red  sea  circulation  and  deep  water ventilation  will  increase  our  understanding of the impacts of the red sea on indian ocean variability. in part 1, various hydroclimate  parameters will be reconstructed from red sea coral geochemical records (sr/ca, δ 18 o)  to  provide  (1)  quantitative  and  independent  evaluations  of  temperature  and  salinity  variability  in  the  red  sea;  (2)  assessments of seasonal to multi-decadal variability during the summer and winter seasons; (3) comparisons  of sst and sss variability between the  northern and central red sea. part 2 assesses red sea sss and  density variability, its drivers and relation to regional climate variability to provide: (1) quantification of  red  sea  deep  water ventilation  variability  in  strength  and  spatial pattern;  (2)  assessment  of  the  linkages  between upwelling and density through comparisons with the δ 14 c water mass tracer; (3) an understanding  of  the  relationship  between  red  sea  variability  and  relevant  climate  systems  (arctic  oscillation,  north  atlantic oscillation, etc.) on interannual to multi-decadal timescales. the 6º of latitudinal range covered by  the corals in this study offer an exciting opportunity to examine circulation patterns throughout much of the  red sea and improve our understanding of variability in the water masses that exit into the indian ocean  to influence the basin’s variability.  broader  impacts: understanding the variability  and  long-term  trends in  salinity,  temperature  and  circulation of the indian ocean and connected marginal seas (e.g. red sea) has implications for predicting  changes  in climate  in  surrounding  countries  and  the  resulting  impacts  to largely  agrarian  societies. the  proposed project will lead to improved understanding of the drivers of red sea low-frequency salinity and  deep  water  ventilation  variability,  and  will  aid  in  climate  and  ocean  circulation  prediction  efforts  in  the  region. the international community has identified the indian ocean and connected marginal seas as areas  requiring  coordinated,  multi-national,  interdisciplinary  research. beyond  these  science  implications,  the  project  provides  an  opportunity  to  educate  the  next  generation  of  scientists through: (1) supporting  and  mentoring  a graduate  student in marine  geochemistry,  paleoclimate  and  physical  oceanography;  (2)  supporting undergaduate summer students in pi murty’s laboratory and an undergraduate honors thesis  with  pi  gillikin  who  will  gain  experience  in  coral  geochemical  analyses  and  paleoclimate  (3)  providing  research  opportunities  to  undergraduate  students with  programs,  such  as  whoi’s  summer  student  fellowships, and the university at albany summer research program. the pis regularly mentor and advise  students  from  these  programs  and  are  committed  to  providing  undergraduates  with  enriching  research  experiences. in addition, pi murty will participate in the synergy ii collaboration between scientists and  artists,  coordinated  by  art  league  rhode  island.  this  collaboration  will  include  video  interviews  and  gallery openings to showcase the potential for combining knowledge from geochemistry and paleoclimate  to understand past variability and future threats to vulnerable societies.

    "cara pager": "project summary  zika virus (zikv) presents a significant health threat, particularly as severe and devastating developmental abnormalities, including microcephaly in babies born from infected women, were identified in the 2015-2016 outbreak in the americas.  thus, elucidating the molecular biology of the virus, virus-host interactions and zikv-directed mechanisms resulting in congenital malformations is of paramount importance.  studies to date show that zikv infects neuroepithelial stem cells and radial glia cells, resulting in cell cycle arrest, altered differentiation, increased cell death and thinner neuronal layers.  moreover rna-seq studies show dramatic changes in the transcriptome.  we however posit that the developmental and neurological anomalies outcomes of zikv infection result from changes in cellular rna homeostasis or ribostasis.  this application proposes to investigate the consequence of zikv inducing the unfolded protein response pathway on cellular mrna splicing and stability and consequence on the innate immune response. in aim 1 we will use different molecular and cell biological approaches to investigate the mode of activation and role of atf3, an integrated stress response transcription factor on zikv infection.  in aim 2, we will use next generation sequencing strategies to investigate the effects of activating atf3 on mrna splicing and stability, and then examine how these changes impact the innate immune response and zikv gene expression.  the outcomes of these studies will reveal new facets of zikv biology and the uncharted regulatory mechanisms that orchestrates cellular responses during zikv infection.  summary zika virus (zikv) infections have been associated with cardiac disfunction and malformations in adults and babies. this along with the expanded transmission route and related neurological and congenital consequence of zikv-infection makes this re-emerging flavivirus a global health threat.  to date, most research efforts have concentrated on the neuronal implications of zikv. in contrast underlying regulatory mechanisms responsible for cardiac-related complications of zikv remain elusive. the unfolded protein response (upr) and innate immunity pathways are particularly important for zikv pathogenesis and infection outcomes. notably, these two pathways also play active roles in cardiovascular diseases. thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the interaction of these pathways in zikv-infected cardiomyocytes will uncover novel mechanisms vital to therapeutic design.  activating transcription factor (atf3) is a key effector of the upr and innate immunity pathways. it is a stress-activated transcription factor that regulates multiple transcriptional events to maintain homeostasis. the type of transcriptional control atf3 provides is defined by the specific stressors and cell type. several virus infection studies such as with mouse cytomegalovirus and japanese encephalitis virus indicate that atf3 is rapidly activated by viral infection and functions to suppress the immune response through a negative-feedback loop. in our recent transcriptional and alternative splicing analyses of zikv infection in a neuroblastoma cell line, we observed that atf3 was elevated. to elucidate the importance of atf3 activation we performed preliminary experiments examining zikv gene expression following infection of wild-type and atf3-knockout hct116 cells. our results demonstrated an atf3-dependent antiviral restriction. we postulate that atf3 is activated by the upr pathway and binds promoters of distinct innate immune effectors to induce a broad antiviral effect that suppresses zikv-infection. in aim 1, we will use molecular and cell biology approaches to elucidate the upstream pathways responsible for atf3 activation in zikv-infected cardiomyocytes. in aim 2, we will utilize next generation sequencing technologies to determine the molecular mechanism of atf3-mediated antiviral control. our results will provide insights into uncharted mechanisms that orchestrate cellular responses and pathological consequence of zikv-infection in the heart.       project summary/abstract  mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as zika virus (zikv), dengue virus (denv) and west nile virus (wnv) are a significant threat to public health, and for which there are no effective licensed antiviral treatments. elucidating the molecular biology of these viruses and the interactions with the host cell are foundational identifying and developing effective antiviral therapies. during flavivirus infection cellular stress response pathways such as the unfolded protein response and integrated stress response play key, but understudied, roles in regulating viral infection. indeed, we recently discovered that activating transcription factor 3 (atf3) is induced following zikv infection. atf3 is known to regulate genes involved in the antiviral response and inflammatory, metabolic, and autophagy-related programs. interestingly we find that during zikv infection atf3 functions to restrict virus infection by regulated innate immune and autophagy factors. this contrasts with the reported proviral role for atf3 during infection with japanese encephalitis virus, a related flavivirus. this paradoxical role of atf3 in infection by two related mosquito-borne flaviviruses is intriguing and suggests that differential transcriptional control mechanisms regulated by atf3 could be transformative to understanding disease. we propose that atf3 regulates select cellular mrnas to coordinate a virus specific response that affects differential flavivirus replication. this multi-pi application combines the unique but complementary strengths of dr. pager in flavivirus-host interaction and dr. sammons in transcriptional biology. in aim 1 we will use different molecular and cell biological approaches to investigate the mode by which atf3 regulates zikv, denv and wnv gene expression and determine the step(s) in the virus infectious that atf3 affects. in aim 2 we will identify direct antiviral gene targets of atf3 in response to flavivirus infection using unbiased, genome-scale assays.  the outcomes of these studies will reveal new facets of flavivirus biology and undefined regulatory mechanisms that orchestrate cellular responses during virus infection.

    "mohammed agamy": "  project summary overview: solid state transformer (sst) is deemed as a revolutionary technology for future power systems. it is  more compact than the conventional electromagnetic transformer, with significant controllability  advantage both in power flow control and fault management. however, one major technical barrier that  constrains the practicality of sst is the low reliability compared to the conventional transformers, due to  the large part count including semiconductor devices, auxiliary circuits, passive components and internal  connections. currently, the reliability of sst has received little attention. to address this challenge, this  proposal will develop a comprehensive systematic framework of online health monitoring for ssts to  significantly improve its reliability to electric failures. the proposed framework will include online  prognosis and diagnosis of potential electrical faults that could occur to sst, targeting common  semiconductor switching faults and health degradation in the high-frequency transformers. specifically, a  portfolio of critical sst parameters will be monitored through a smart gate driver that will be integrated  with the power electronic building blocks, so degradation in the semiconductor modules can be predicted  and diagnosed during the fault incipient stage. a novel data driven digital twin approach is proposed to  predict the behavior of the sst converter modules and it will compute specific health performance  indices to make it more computationally effective compared to full physical model computations. fast  online diagnostic algorithm will be developed and embedded in the sst microcontroller, so a fault can be  identified and characterized, to minimize downtime cost and avoid cascaded failures.    intellectual merit: the proposed project of developing health monitoring framework for sst will provide the most reliable  and efficient solution for ssts to be used in the next-generation power transmission and distribution. the  specific merits of the project include: 1) highly accurate lifetime prediction of the sst power blocks. the  accuracy of the lifetime estimation of the power blocks is determined by the fidelity of the junction  temperature estimation of the semiconductor devices. different from conventional junction temperature  estimation methods, more sensitive semiconductor parameters such as the turn-on dv/dt is used for  junction temperature estimation, due to the better linearity. 2) faster online fault diagnosis of sst  converters, with a fault detection speed of 5x~10x faster than the conventional detection strategies. we  will fully leverage voltage and current sensory information, in combination with the switching state  information of the sst. 3) new data-driven digital twin for sst converters using a graph neural  network approach. the proposed method link circuit connection, component values and behavioral  variables of interest. this method is scalable and permutation invariant. a combination of simulation and  test results will be used for training the digital twin model 4) smart gate drivers with embedded sensing  and local health monitoring model. the resonant converter signal feedbacks of the sst will be measured  in the gate driver to estimate the accuracy of the high frequency link tuning by tracking phase shift  voltage and current & peak current. this will enable auto-tuning of the sst circuit operating point for  active power cycling lifetime extension.    broader impacts: the proposed work has paramount impact on the reliability improvement of sst and pebbs for safety- critical applications, such as future power systems and transportation applications. if successful, this work  on the rul prediction and extension, as well as the online fast non-intrusive fault diagnosis of switching  faults, will enhance the reliability of the pebbs to a new milestone. the proposed approach also presents  a significant advancement of the use of artificial intelligence methods in power electronics modeling. the  outcomes of the proposed methods will result in new classes of power electronics design tools and will  enable a fully integrated design process that will generate new topologies, substantially cut design and  implementation times. in addition to topology synthesis, these approaches will enhance reliability  modeling where reliability can be accurately estimated from the design stage even for newly synthesized  architectures. from an educational standpoint this work presents an opportunity to tie ai programming to  power electronics engineering. hence upgrading power electronics and advanced power electronics  curricula and providing power electronics engineers with an effective skillset for converter design.          project summary  overview  in this proposal, power converter and control concepts for very high frequency modular dc-ac inverters will  be investigated. the proposed inverter architectures target industrial electromagnetic heating applications  where very high  output fundamental frequency and  high  efficiency  are  essential  design  objectives. the  building blocks of the proposed inverter will operate at switching frequencies in the order of hundreds of  khz  to  achieve  high  power  density  and  enable  the  implementation  of  module  building  blocks  of  10s  of  kilowatts and up to hundreds of kw using printed circuit boards, which results in high power density, light  weight and lends itself to automated manufacturing. fundamental frequency at the output will range from  tens of khz to 100s of khz, with output voltages up to 20kv.  the proposed approach leverages advances in silicon carbide semiconductor devices and high-power high  frequency  resonant  converters.  resonant  converters enable  high  frequency  operation  with  natural  soft  switching; therefore  a very  high  switching  frequency  can  be  used.  with  series  stacking  of  modules  and  using interleaved pulse width modulation an output ripple at very high frequency can be produced and thus  minimize  the  output  filtering  requirements.  soft  switching  wide  bandgap devices  not only  improve  efficiency  but  also  reduces  electromagnetic  interference  filter  requirements  and  reduces  stresses  on  the  insulation system of converter components.  the scope of this proposal includes the (1) design of resonant based high frequency inverter topologies, (2)  hierarchical control architecture to generate the required output voltage and frequency, provide redundant  operation of operation of modules to improve reliability, and (3) system level monitoring and diagnostics  using  converter terminal  and  internal  signals along  with  component  and  system  level  models and  (4)  experimental verification using a scaled down lab prototype.  intellectual merit  the approaches explored in this proposal will establish high frequency resonant converters as an effective  solution for industrial high power medium voltage power conversion with very high fundamental output  frequencies and advanced hierarchical control systems that combine the input/output variable regulation as  well  as  model  based  operating  point  optimization  and  converter  health  monitoring,  thus  enabling  high  efficiency (>98%) and enhanced reliability. using resonant converter methods is projected to improve the  process efficiency by over 15% compared to standard rf amplifier approaches.   the proposed inverter systems target the combination of megawatt scale power and switching frequencies  in the order of hundreds of kilohertz. this provides an order of magnitude improvement in power density  over existing silicon or silicon carbide based technologies. modular approach incorporates redundancy and  thus high system availability. the soft switching and galvanic isolation provided in the proposed solutions  also  improves  the  emi  performance  of  the  inverters.  further,  multi-layer  control  platform  is  proposed,  which combines model based converter control, system level optimization as well as health monitoring and  fault mitigation methods for the modular inverter.   broader impacts  modular wide bandgap resonant inverters are seen as a critical enabler for high efficiency industrial power  conversion. the high bandwidth of resonant converter controllers positions them to address requirements  of  complex  time  varying  load  patterns.  further,  the  multi-layer  control  system  can  also  be  extended  to  different  dc/dc and  dc/ac  converter  applications. the  proposed  fast  constant  power  impedance  tracking  control can be leveraged in high power static and dynamic wireless charging applications. the proposed  research will give u.s. industry a competitive edge in modular power converter architectures, which can  be adopted in different applications.   the proposal also includes educational and outreach activities that complement the proposed research, with  course development, graduate and undergraduate students being trained on both converter development and  control implementation as well as outreach to industries & technical community to educate on the different  aspects of the proposed topologies and control systems.    experimental characterization & analysis of mems for power relay applications  abstract  micro  electromechanical  switches (mems)  have  several  key  characteristics  that  make  them  suitable for next generation relays and circuit breakers. these characteristics include: i. they can  provide  full  galvanic  isolation  as  compared  to  solid  state  breakers that  require  additional  mechanical  disconnects.  ii.  very  fast  response  time (in  the  order  of  micro-seconds).  iii.  small  footprint.  iv)  ease  of  smart  grid  integration  due  to  enhanced  sensing  and  communication  functions included in mems circuits.  to  operate as  relays  and  breakers,  mems  need  to  be  able  to  interface  with  a  variety  of  loads  (resistive,  inductive,  capacitive  and non-linear). the  variety of  load  characteristics  requires the  device  to  withstand  varying  levels of  voltage  and  current  stresses during switching  transitions.  on the other hand, to have an extended mems device life the device should be switched at zero  voltage  and  current.  therefore,  auxiliary  circuits  are  required  to  achieve  these  soft  switching  conditions. another requirement to enable the use of mems in circuit breaker applications is the  ability to operate at high currents and voltage.  therefore, the objective of this project is to characterize mems as single devices and arrays under  different  grid  and  load  operating  conditions.  device switching  characteristics  under  different  loading types and levels will first be quantified. the next step will be to define voltage and current  limits for safe device operation through devices testing to failure and failure mode analysis. these  tests will  define  i)  safe  steady  state  voltage  and  current  limits,  ii)  limitations  on  voltage  and  current  levels  during  switch  transition  and  iii) auxiliary  circuit  components  and  switching  time  limits. finally, scalability  of  mems  to  higher  voltages  and  currents. to  this  end,  test  circuits  to  evaluate series and parallel switch arrays will be designed and series/parallel operation will be  tested, namely i) static voltage and current sharing, ii) transient voltage and current sharing and  iii) auxiliary circuit timing requirements.        topic area 1- electric vehicle traction

 albany (ualbany) and gan systems, proposes to develop an ultra-compact 800v traction inverter  based  on commercial 650v  gallium  nitride  (gan)  field  effect  transistors  (fets)  for  electric  vehicle (ev) applications. this gan inverter is based on a 3-level active  neutral point clamped  (anpc) circuit topology, which possesses the benefits of high waveform quality, low dv/dt in the  output line voltages, reduced common-mode voltages, and fault-tolerant operation capability. an  innovative pulse width modulation strategy which can avoid large commutation loops of the anpc  inverters will be developed. a 75-kw gan anpc inverter prototype with liquid cooling will be  tested with a permanent magnet synchronous motor (pmsm) in the lab, and the system benefits  including  the  motor  loss  reduction  resulting  from  the  high-frequency  inverter  operation  will  be  quantified and reported in the end of the project.         applicant organization:  university of

on an new optimized β-ga 2 o 3  mosfet. the proposed breaker leverages the advantages of  the β-ga 2 o 3  mosfet including low specific on resistance and stability to high temperature and  radiation exposure. dual active gate control will be used to optimize the switching transition and  control  thermal  energy  distribution  at  fault  interruption.  the  modular  structure  provides  the  following advantages: scalable with lower voltage devices, requires discrete devices, no module  design is required (improved simplicity and lower cost), high redundancy/up time independent of  device  failure  mode, suitable  for  ac  and  dc  applications and integrated  sensing and  circuit  parameter monitoring. the proposed breaker will be tested at low voltage with a single module  and at medium voltage (2.25kv) with a stack of 5 modules. the proposed effort can be split into  5 key activities:  1. device fabrication and testing  2. sscb circuit build and validation  3. system integration and packaging  4. analyze compliance to do-160 test requirements.  5. commercialization.

    "zai liang": " migration, contagion, and mortality related to covid-19 project summary: since the late december 2019 and early 2020, the outbreak of covid-19 from chinese city of wuhan has spread to the rest of china and internationally in recent weeks. as of early june, 2020, the total number of infections in the world is over 6 million with more than 400,000 deaths (johns hopkins u., 2020).  this project aims to examine the impact of population migration from the city of wuhan on the spread of covid-19 and fatality in other parts of china.  we draw on literature linking urbanization and health as well literature on social networks and health to derive hypotheses related to infections and fatality from covid-19.  the project contributes theoretically and empirically to the literature on migration, disease contagion, and health.  theoretically, our project deviates from the typical assumption that population is well mixed for disease transmission.  thus, our hypotheses link infections and fatality to city to city migration flows, transportation and medical infrastructure, and population density at the city level.   in addition, we argue that different types of migrants (e.g. migrant workers vs. business travelers) have different propensities to transmit the virus to their social networks.  furthermore, we will address the issue of excess mortality in an effort to more fully account for the cost of covid-19 for people and society.  empirically, the project takes advantage of access to big data on migration from internet company baidu along with infection and fatality data for each city.  the first aim is to visualize spatial patterns of migration, infections, and fatality at the city level.  the second aim is to estimate multilevel poisson models of disease diffusion and fatality with migration as one of the leading predicting variables.  the third aim is to estimate spatial models of patterns of contagion and fatality. the final aim is to evaluate excess mortality for cities in china. the project is important as it addresses the most critical public health crisis facing china and the world today.   it will enhance our understanding of how migration/mobility, transportation and health care infrastructure affect the infection and fatality associated covid-19. the issue is particularly important in the globalizing age of the 21st century as migration/travel is greatly facilitated through modern modes of transportation, which also leads to speedy transmission of virus to the extent that we have not observed before. the unique and extremely valuable big data on migration affords an unparalleled opportunity to study the long-standing scholarly topic of migration and health and the research is likely to generate significant new insights, and advance the field of migration and disease contagion.      the transformative spatial dispersion of the immigrant second generation has presented challenges for schools in new immigrant destinations (nid) and immigrant families.  our estimates suggest that the proportion of immigrant children in nid has risen from 5% in 1990 to 18% in 2019.  using a mixed method approach, the proposed project examines educational outcomes of immigrant children in nid. the project is important on several grounds.  first, much of what we know about the immigrant second generation is based on major studies in gateway cities in the u.s. thus our study will advance critical knowledge on assimilation of the second generation in nid.  second, schools in nid may not be ready to fully serve the need of immigrant children, immigrant families may lose some of the ethnic social capital and resources, and children of certain immigrant groups may be subject to rising fear of parental undocumented status and possible arrest/deportation by immigrant and customs enforcement.  the quantitative part of the project takes advantage of a recently released high school longitudinal survey (2009) with follow-ups in 2012 and 2016.  we will use multilevel modeling method to study short term (high school) and long term (college) educational consequences of settlement in nid.  the project will be complemented by a qualitative research component which involves interviews with school administrators, parents, and students in established destinations and nid.

    "james schwab": "establishment and operation of a long island south shore special monitoring site proposal submitted to nescaum in response to its rfp pi: dr. james schwab  project summary the new york city metropolitan area, which includes long island, has been classified as moderate nonattainment for ozone based on the 2015 national ambient air quality standard (naaqs) ever since it came into effect. (the region has been nonattainment under all relevant standards for decades.) long island and southern connecticut have been particularly problematic, and there has been increasing realization that the land-water interface is playing a role in many of the extreme ozone concentrations observed at these locations (references). there are a number of factors at play in this region affecting the persistent pollution problems posed by high ozone (and pm2.5) and many of these factors have been discussed in the nescaum 2017 draft white paper on the subject (http://www.nescaum.org/documents/nyc-metro-lis-ozone-whitepaper-draft-v5.pdf ). as noted in the rfp, the long island sound tropospheric ozone study (listos) was launched in 2018 in response to these concerns and joined other regional collaborative field and modeling studies to address, among other things, the influence of urban emissions, summertime meteorological conditions and the land-water interface on coastal and near-coastal pollution observed in numerous locations (the october 2020 issue of em magazine highlighted four of these prominent studies). in addition to listos, these studies included the lake michigan ozone study (lmos, vermeuel et al., 2019; abdi-oskouei et al., 2020); the ozone water-land experimental transition study (owlets) which took place over two years (2017 and 2018) over different portions of the chesapeake bay (sullivan et al., 2019); ); and the satellite coastal and oceanic atmospheric pollution experiment (scoape) along the louisiana coast in 2019 (thompson et al., 2020).  much has been learned from these sharply focused efforts, but knowledge and data gaps remain. our mobile laboratory study as part of the 2018 listos field campaign identified one of these data gaps and a motivating factor for the rfp (zhang et al., 2020). namely, a very sharp horizontal gradient in ozone concentration was observed upon approach to jones beach in robert moses state park on the south shore of long island. the high ozone observed on june 30th, 2018 at this location (over 100 ppb) was roughly 40 ppb higher than values observed in the middle and northern parts of long island. the new york state department of environmental conservation (dec) did not report ozone exceedances at any of their four sites in the long island counties of nassau and suffolk that day. this high level of heterogeneity in surface ozone was unexpected, and would have gone unnoticed if not for the mobile laboratory deployment and measurements. conventional reasoning was that the typical factors producing ozone (precursor emissions plus ultraviolet radiation plus oxidation chemistry) would generally yield oxidant levels that increase downwind while precursors remained, but would not have sharp gradients. (this is true for total oxidants or odd oxygen (ox), effectively equal to the sum of o3 and no2 in this scenario. each species individually may display sharp gradients, but the sum is expected vary more smoothly.) the results of this study point out the necessity of establishing a measurement station near the land-sea interface on long island's south shore. such is the request of the rfp, and the plan of the proposed work.  the mechanism of the observed high ozone for the june 30, 2018 case involved an interplay of enhanced emissions due to the heatwave conditions, nearly stagnant synoptic flow which only weakly ventilated precursor emissions from the densest part of the metro area, heat, humidity, and uv radiation for producing ozone, and a sea-breeze circulation to move air back onto long island's south shore. more specifically, analysis of winds and back trajectories tracked the movement of nyc air with precursor emissions over the new york / new jersey bight where significant ozone production and concentration increase occurred (aided by the more shallow marine boundary layer and smaller depositional loss over the water). under \"just right\" conditions of afternoon sea-breeze circulation flow, this \"pool\" of higher ozone air could be transported back onto land, in this case along long island's south shore. on one hand this conceptual model of high ozone along shorelines requires the coming together of many puzzle parts, and on the other it describes a phenomenon that is widely observed along coastlines adjacent to urban areas (see references above for additional examples for additional examples for the chicago, baltimore-washington, and houston metro areas).  the new monitoring site along the south shore of long island would be tremendously helpful in our quest to better understand this puzzle. first, it would provide us a continuous measure of ozone and nitrogen dioxide (total oxidants) for a part of long island that is know to be under sampled. second the associated measurements of vocs and carbonyls will help elucidate the photochemical reactivity of the air masses before and after sea breeze circulation sets in, which will provide important constraints on the ozone production rates involved. to this end, we propose deploying our new continuously measuring portable gc at the site when it is not being used for previously committed projects. this instrument is discussed more in the next section. the monitoring site will include a weather sensor to capture local meteorology, and will also utilize data from all three long island mesonet profiler sites at wantagh, stony brook, and east hampton. like the new monitoring site, wantagh and east hampton are on the south shore of long island and their wind profiler data are extremely valuable for identifying onset, strength, and depth of sea breeze circulation cells, as was done by zhang et al. (2020). the combination of continuous oxidant data, more and better voc data, and continuous detailed wind data throughout the lower troposphere will allow for a more complete and rigorous mapping of these important influences on ozone concentrations and fluctuations at the monitoring site, and by extension, across much of long island.  the project will develop these new and important data and use analysis tools and collaboration with modelers at dec and asrc to explain the mechanisms for ozone formation and transport in this complicated environment. this greater understanding will in turn help scientists, regulators and policy makers come to better informed and more effective policy decisions related to reducing ozone pollution that affects the millions of residents of long island. we also hope to develop scientific advances in the field (measurements, analysis, and/or modeling) that can be used by other regions or groups facing similar issues elsewhere.

    "aveek dutta": "  project summary overview: the proposal presents a new paradigm of coexistence between next generation wireless networks and  passive radio astronomy telescopes in time, frequency and space. the main objective of this project is to  innovate methods to decompose astronomical and interference signals from nearby cellular networks in  order to isolate and cancel interference using deep learning models. if successful, it will enhance the  fidelity of astronomical measurements in radio telescopes, while increasing spatial spectrum reuse of  wireless networks. interference is measured at each cellular base station, learned using a distributed  algorithm, and aggregated across heterogeneous networks to share with the telescope. this knowledge is  used to cancel the interference at the telescope using data-driven deep neural networks. it facilitates inter- technology interference cancellation by active bidirectional collaboration. continuous feedback from the  telescope also improves the performance of the interference characterization and the learning models.  these enhancements will transcend the telescopes from passive devices to cognitive and intelligent  instruments, greatly increasing its contribution to future astronomical explorations. the system will be  validated using over-the-air experiments at the owens valley radio observatory (ovro) and prototype  software defined radios for customized interference injection.    intellectual merit: the intellectual merit of this proposal lies in four transformative areas: 1) a fast and efficient neural  network architecture for decomposing signals into orthogonal stochastic components with domain  specific knowledge for high accuracy. this  unified approach is used to characterize rfi at its source  (4g/5g cellular networks), termed as rfi kernel, while simultaneously applied to the contaminated  astronomical signal at the telescope, called the space kernel; 2) the fidelity of the rfi kernel is  maximized by innovating a topology aware distributed learning and intelligent aggregation across various  entities (small and macro cells) of the cellular network; 3) the rfi kernel is shared with the radio  telescope to cancel the rfi present in the contaminated signal by employing computationally efficient  orthogonal projection of the kernel spaces using the same neural network used to generate the space  kernel at the telescope; 4) this is made practical by a higher layer bidirectional collaboration protocol  between the cellular base station and the telescope to continuously cancel rfi, while providing  quantitative feedback on the quality of recovery of the desired astronomical signal at the telescope, to  optimize the generation of rfi kernel at the cellular network. furthermore, we create an experimental  setup to inject realistic rfi to the deep synoptic array telescope (dsa-110) at the ovro to emulate the  problem envisioned in the proposal. the signals acquired from this field measurement over three years  will be invaluable to validate the proposed research and to the broader community of radio astronomy and  wireless communication.    broader impacts: this proposal will be instrumental in changing the way passive radio astronomy extracts astronomical  information. this is a major societal impact as lower uncertainty in scientific data will allow for  continued exploration into the unknowns of the universe. this project will also increase the overall  utilization of the rf spectrum, thus facilitating high bandwidth reliable wireless connectivity to support  future wireless applications like sensory based education, interactive remote health diagnosis, or  immersive entertainment. also, the research activities within this project will assure human connection in  the virtual world, even in times of uncertainty. the platform and tools developed in this project will be  incorporated in multiple graduate and undergraduate courses as well as summer school in ovro. the  highly diverse student body in the ece department in ualbany includes traditionally under-represented  communities who will greatly benefit from using these new skills of problem solving in their coursework.  wireless signals and other datasets captured from the testbed will be made available to the larger  community to foster practical research in this field. the pis will also arrange periodic online panels to  stimulate conversation among the researchers in wireless communication and radio astronomy areas.

    "jerald brotzge": "  proposal title:    a novel adaptive multi-sensor approach for detection of snowmelt and refreeze events    submitted to:    nasa roses 2020 a.33 “the science of terra, aqua, suomi-npp, and jpss series satellites”    pi:    samuel tuttle (syracuse university)    co-is:    eunsang cho (university of maryland)  david chandler (syracuse university)   jerald brotzge (university at albany)  junhong wang (university at albany)  joan ramage (lehigh university)      proposal summary:    snowmelt is important for water resources (including water supply and flood forecasting) and a  range of hydrological, ecological, and snowpack processes. microwave remote sensing can be  used to detect the presence of liquid water in snow, by leveraging the vastly different radiative  properties of “dry” (i.e. frozen) versus “wet” (i.e. containing liquid water) snow. however, few  freely available satellite snowmelt datasets exist, and the ones that do exist are not extensively  validated and are either limited by poor spatial or temporal resolution, or have limited areal  coverage. most methods do not easily translate to different locations.    our project will apply a dynamic snowmelt detection method, based on a simple machine  learning technique and an empirical relationship between passive microwave (pm) brightness  temperature (tb) and coincident surface temperature, to identify snowmelt and refreeze  events from diurnal satellite observations. this method improves on current snowmelt  detection techniques by removing the effect of diurnal temperature changes on tb, thereby  isolating the contribution of snow phase changes (i.e. diurnal emissivity change due to  appearance and disappearance of liquid water in the snowpack). it is adaptive in that it can be  applied in different locations and at different scales without needing to specify any input  parameters. the method will be applied to a recently released pm tb dataset (cetb, which  includes amsr-e; brodzik et al., 2016, updated 2020) with higher spatial resolution (down to 3  km) than was previously available (25 km). the combination of high spatial and temporal  resolution could greatly increase the utility of pm observations for snowmelt monitoring.    the proposed research seeks to assess the value of the proposed snowmelt detection method  for monitoring snowpack melt processes in different climates zones, and to determine how  much information satellite melt detection can reveal about internal snowpack melt dynamics  over the course of the snow season. it involves four main tasks:     1) develop the proposed snowmelt detection method. a proof-of-concept study has been  conducted at one location, but the dynamic elements of the method have not been evaluated  and may require further modification.    2) apply the snowmelt detection method to the cetb dataset, with its multiple sensor  platforms, spatial resolutions, and microwave frequencies. additionally, multiple surface  temperature datasets (e.g. airs, modis/viirs) will be used to evaluate the uncertainty in the  method due to choice of input data.    3) evaluate the detected snowmelt events using a variety of direct and indirect data, including  ground observations (e.g. snow liquid water content, energy balance observations, snow  temperature) and model output (noah-mp). this will be done at sites in the western u.s.  (snowex sites) and in the eastern u.s. (new york and vermont), two regions with very different  climate and snowpack properties.    4) analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of snowmelt and refreeze occurrence in the western  and eastern sites from task 3, which will reveal if and how the frequency and timing of melt  and refreeze events have changed over the course of the past 20+ years, a period of  accelerating climate change.    the global hydrological cycles and water resources panel of the most recent decadal survey  listed snowmelt as an important variable for addressing some of its “most important” and  “important” objectives, and observing the presence or absence of snow liquid water at high  spatiotemporal resolution could help to address these objectives. additionally, recent snow  observation efforts (e.g. snowex campaigns) have highlighted the fact that no one remote  sensing technique will work to characterize snow properties in all environments.  thus, snow  liquid water information will be crucial to inform the combination of modeling and remote  sensing that will be necessary for accurate global snow monitoring.  nyiso mesonet weather data subscription - sow 1 year  the research foundation for the state university of new york has developed the nys mesonet to deliver high-quality weather observations. the data is made available to users who can benefit from the data. nyiso is obtaining non-exclusive rights to use the data for internal and business purposes.   the following variables will be provided for each of the stations. air temperature at two meters air temperature at nine  meters relative humidity at two meters liquid equivalent precipitation wind speed direction wind direction standard deviation solar radiation at 2 meters atmosphere station pressure snow depth soil temperature soil moisture  nasa proposal, statement of work title: \"surface-based precipitation measurement network in the bronx: science and education for diverse and minority students\" this project proposes to install a nasa rain gauge at lehman college to be used as a catalyst for enhanced student teaching of diverse and minority students.  as co-pi on the project, dr. jerry brotzge will provide meteorological expertise to the program, aiding the pi and co-pis in the development and applications of educational material using the nasa gauge. in addition, dr. brotzge will make additional new york state mesonet (http://www.nysmesonet.org/, nysm) and nyc micronet (http://www.nysmesonet.org/networks/nyc) data, station-generated photos and metadata available to the project. these additional data will be used for comparative studies and additional enhancement of student exploration. for example, archived data from the nasa gauge, nysm, and nyc micronet data will allow for a wide range of spatial and temporal studies. dr. brotzge will work with the pi/co-pi to identify interesting case studies from the data to maximize student interest. these historical data will provide context for the nasa gauge and extend the period of record.

    "kenneth halvorsen": "  our vision is to develop, apply, and disseminate new technologies in molecular biosensing, single-molecule analysis, and dna nanotechnology. a common thread in these main topics is the manipulation and study of nucleic acids for biomedical applications. much focus is on rna applications in particular, which is both driven and enhanced by our unique environment at the rna institute, enabling easy collaboration and cross pollination of ideas and techniques across fields. the importance of rna and rna technologies has never been clearer, with a pandemic rna virus (sars-cov-2) being managed by rna biosensing tools and mrna-based vaccines. it is now well accepted that rna plays a complex role in biology that goes far beyond the \"central dogma\". in this proposal, carried out over the next five years, we aim to advance technology in three main areas: 1) dna nanoswitches as programmable nanoscale reagents for reporting molecular interactions, 2) the centrifuge force microscope (cfm) for high throughput single molecule probing and analysis, and 3) dna nanotechnology for applications in drug delivery and sensing. each of these areas builds on our strengths and past performance.  in the first area, we use dna nanoswitches as \"smart\" reagents that change conformation upon binding a target molecule. building on past success, we will expand this innovative method to enable low cost and simple rna detection, quantification, and purification for various rnas. these include detection of rna modifications, detection of regulatory lncrnas, and purification of rna and rna complexes. in the second area, we will develop and execute assays for the centrifuge force microscope (cfm) in rna and dna interaction analysis and rna structure-function probing. in particular, we will investigate fundamental thermodynamics of weak interactions in dna and rna, develop a new method for single-molecule structural probing of rna, and study the structure-function relationship of a pre-clinical therapeutic ribozyme. in the third area, relatively new for our lab, we expand work to analyze and develop dna nanotechnology for applications including drug delivery. specifically, we are interested in understanding and \"programming\" biostability into dna nanostructures, and in coordinating chemical attachment and triggered release of molecular payloads from dna nanostructures.  this proposal aims to carry out ambitious research and development plans performed within the context of several biomedical projects. the impact of the developments will extend beyond the individual projects, as our core technologies and methods are increasingly adopted by other groups. in the first mira term we have proven our ability to develop impactful technology and advance innovative science on several fronts. in this second term, we aim show sustainability of our research endeavors, solidifying our niches, maintaining high productivity, and ultimately producing knowledge and tools to benefit the scientific community.  scope of work  the team at ualbany, led by drs. halvorsen, sheng, and vangaveti will conduct a substantial portion of the work designed to identify the underlying mechanism of enhanced catalysis in facilitated-hammerhead ribozymes, which have 1-2 log enhanced catalytic performance against short unstructured substrates relative to the same ribozymes embedded in restrictive scaffolds.    the halvorsen lab will use a combination of biophysical approaches (e.g. itc, uv melting, single-molecule methods) to determine thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanistic changes involved in ribozyme binding, substrate cleavage, and ribozyme release.   the sheng lab will integrate rna modifications to the ribozyme to enhance the catalytic rate, and to protect the ribozyme from rnase degradation. they will also perform rna crystallography to get structural data of the ribozyme alone and in complex with a minimal target.  the vangaveti lab will supplement these experimental studies with molecular simulations to model the atomistic structural rearrangements that take place throughout different steps of the process.   this work as a whole will result in a mechanistic understanding by which the facilitator element(s) enhance catalytic activity of therapeutic ribozymes and identify new testable hypotheses

unstructured substrates relative to the same ribozymes embedded in restrictive scaffolds.    the halvorsen lab will use a combination of biophysical approaches (e.g. itc, uv melting, single-molecule methods) to determine thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanistic changes involved in ribozyme binding, substrate cleavage, and ribozyme release.   the sheng lab will integrate rna modifications to the ribozyme to enhance the catalytic rate, and to protect the ribozyme from rnase degradation. they will also perform rna crystallography to get structural data of the ribozyme alone and in complex with a minimal target.  the vangaveti lab will supplement these experimental studies with molecular simulations to model the atomistic structural rearrangements that take place throughout different steps of the process.   this work as a whole will result in a mechanistic understanding by which the facilitator element(s) enhance catalytic activity of therapeutic ribozymes and identify new testable hypotheses for further enhancement and optimization of the therapeutic efficacy of the lead ribozymes.

including the center of excellence (coe), the atmospheric sciences research center (asrc), the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences (daes) - and ualbany's first in the nation college of emergency preparedness, homeland security, and cybersecurity (cehc) to address this operational gap. this gap is addressed here - inspired by multiple conversations with division of homeland security and emergency services (dhses) leadership, including commissioner bray.  this proposal promptly addresses urgent short-term meteorological needs by leveraging local expertise in support of state emergency management while also identifying potential future enhancements. ualbany's coe and nys mesonet have a long history of providing timely weather information and interpretation to dhses, and this proposal codifies and strengthens this relationship while ensuring continued access to nys mesonet data. the coe has several meteorologists with expertise ranging from forecasting to data analysis to product development to communication who can immediately begin work on a variety of key deliverables, outlined below. most urgently, weather forecasting and analysis expertise can be delivered on agreed-upon timetables upon project outset. while this is ongoing, ualbany will work closely with dhses stakeholders to identify key improvements and critical weather thresholds to further aid situational awareness and decision-making. upon conclusion of this project, a final report will propose measures to position dhses to become a nation-leader in state preparation and response to weather of all types. proposed deliverables fall into three categories, discussed below.  the polar and subtropical jet streams are among the most recognizable structures within earth's atmosphere and can modulate weather conditions at middle latitudes. the polar and subtropical jets typically remain separate from one another, but occasionally merge to form a polar-subtropical jet superposition. a jet superposition is characterized by anomalously strong wind speeds that may exceed 100 m s-1, a steep, single-step tropopause structure, and the consolidation of the pole-to-equator baroclinicity into a narrow zone of contrast within the near-jet environment. consequently, a potent dynamical and thermodynamic environment conducive to the development of high-impact weather accompanies jet superpositions. this relationship between jet superpositions and high-impact weather motivates further investigation into the predictability of jet superpositions and their accompanying sensible weather impacts. the proposed work utilizes an objective jet identification scheme to isolate north american jet superposition events in the ncep cfsr during september-may 1979-2021 and to classify those events into event types based on the deviations of the polar and subtropical jets from their respective climatological latitude bands to form a jet superposition. the proposed work targets three core research objectives using the identified events as the basis for all ensuing analyses. first, the proposed work will use archived gefs and ecmwf forecast data to determine the systematic forecast biases that characterize the development of jet superpositions and how those biases vary as a function of season and jet superposition event type. second, the proposed work will perform ensemble sensitivity analyses and construct wrf ensembles for high forecast error events to examine the physical processes that contribute to forecast errors during jet superposition events. third, the proposed work will determine the extent to which sensible weather conditions within the near-jet environment are sensitive to forecast uncertainties connected to the physical processes that govern the development of jet superpositions.

(for more  information about cb's programs, visit http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb).  the role of workforce development initiatives  workforce development initiatives in the field of child welfare is critical. a goal of cb  throughout much of its history has been to ensure that the workforce in public child welfare  within both states and tribes is educated and trained to perform the difficult task of working  with families and children who have been neglected and/or abused. while there has been  positive movement in understanding how to best meet the needs of children and families in the  child welfare system, the long-standing issue of recruiting, preparing, and retaining adequate  numbers of child welfare staff continues to be a problem for child welfare agencies (state,  county, and tribal). while lack of a qualified applicant pool and issues of staff turnover have  been recognized as a widespread problem for years, its impact on child welfare practice  outcomes has not been carefully examined until recently. over time, it has become clear that  even basic improvements in child welfare practice and outcomes for children and families  involved with child welfare will not be realized without improvements in the child welfare  workforce.  cb intends to continue a multi-pronged approach to building the capacity of the child welfare  workforce, building upon the lessons learned through previous cb workforce initiatives:  1. those who provide front line services to children, youth, and families must be recruited,  educated, trained, supported, and developed professionally in innovative ways. building  the child welfare workforce requires people with excellent skills doing high-quality  work.  2. agencies must improve their organizational cultures if they intend to retain their  workforce and achieve better outcomes for children, youth, and families. cb wishes to  support healthy child welfare organizations that value their people, support best  practices in case management, provide evidence-based and evidence-informed  interventions in treatment and hospitable environments, and effectively collaborate with  partner agencies to ensure that children, youth, and families are safe, healing, and  thriving.  3. academic partners must include in their curriculum the content knowledge that will  teach the wide array of skills needed to prepare high-quality professionals in child  welfare.  in the academies that train and in agencies that serve, the desired result is to  support the workforce to promote the physical safety, and social and emotional well-  3 of 54 being of children and families.  additional information regarding cb's previous ncwwi work and an overview of the current  ncwwi project and its various components can be found in the appendix section.  project requirements  target population  the target population for this grant is a varied and diverse group, including members of the  state and tribal child welfare workforce (from agency directors to public child welfare  professionals directly serving children and families),  prospective child welfare professionals  who are pursuing social work degrees, child welfare faculty, and deans and directors of schools  of social work.  collaboration  in addition to its partnership with cb  (for more information, see section ii. federal award  information, description of acf’s anticipated substantial involvement under the cooperative  agreement), the grantee will be responsible for collaborating with other federal projects,  including, but not limited to, capacity building center for states, the capacity building center  for tribes, the capacity building center for courts, the child welfare information gateway,  the quality improvement center on workforce development, and other cb-funded and federal  interagency projects aimed at increasing the capacity of the workforce to meet the needs of  children and families.  outreach and engagement  in order to successfully reach its target audiences and achieve its goals for participation and use  of ncwwi tools and resources, the grantee must have clear and deliberate strategies for  outreach and engagement. the ncwwi must engage its intended consumers in the  development and refinement of its training activities and products. the project will seek  feedback from members of its target audience(s) throughout the project period to better  understand workforce development needs, inform project activities, review curricula and  product-related content, and proposed dissemination strategies.  program strategies and activities    (1) university partnership projects  the ncwwi will allocate funding for traineeship projects in partnership with other public  and/or nonprofit institutions of higher education with accredited social work education  programs. these 5-year projects will support professional education for current or prospective  child welfare practitioners who are currently enrolled or who plan to enroll in a bachelor or  master social work program. a minimum of ten traineeship projects shall be identified,  selected, and administered in partnership with eligible institutions of higher education. these  projects will include direct stipends to students, administration of the stipends, participation in a  cross-site evaluation, and provision of additional support services for students that will increase  the likelihood of traineeship completion and retention of graduates in the field of child welfare.  required assurances and evidence of compliance for stipend recipients can be found at section  426(c) of the social security act.  for more information on these assurances, please see section  iv.2 content and form of application submission, required forms, assurances, and   4 of 54 certifications.  activities for university partnership projects include:   identifying, selecting, and administering traineeship projects for local, professional  educational traineeships through a stipend/scholar program;   implementing an educational program that increases the knowledge and skills and  leadership capacity of individual stipend recipients to address the social and emotional  needs of children, youth, and families served by child welfare agencies;   developing and/or enhancing child welfare curricula on the developmental and  functional consequences of trauma (for children, youth, and workers) and evidence- based practices to increase stipend recipients skill level, professional practice and  leadership ability, and to support retention in the child welfare workforce;   implementing an organizational intervention component linking the school of social  work with the local public child welfare agency. the partnership will include  exploration of innovative approaches to preparation for child welfare work as well as a  strong transition from school to work approach demonstrating effectiveness in  supporting retention of qualified, competent staff;   tailoring organizational interventions to the specific needs of the local public child  welfare agency and employing a strong evaluation component; and   implementing traineeships as early as possible during the first fiscal year of the  cooperative   agreement, at least prior to the start of the academic year in the fall of 2019.  (2) organizational interventions to improve workforce recruitment and retention  the ncwwi organizational interventions are expected to confront issues related to staff  recruitment, training, supervision, management, and retention. all of the workforce strategies  that the grantee and its partner(s) choose to pursue must be consistent with both the guiding  principles of this foa and with the applicable agency’s mission. an important objective of this  partnership will be to assist the agency in sustaining its systemic change initiative and to  integrate its staff recruitment and retention approaches into the agency’s strategic plan.  activities for organizational interventions include:   selecting and engaging with five to seven state or tribal child welfare agencies through  binding memoranda of agreements (moas) that clearly lay out the roles,  responsibilities, and expectations of both parties to implement an innovative,  comprehensive, and integrated organizational, educational, and professional  development approach to effective child welfare agency workforce development  building upon the last two iterations of ncwwi work;   selecting organizational interventions through the process of a comprehensive  assessment of the recruitment, training, and retention system of the child welfare  agency, and implementing interventions through the use of a design team or other  teaming approach with appropriate internal and external partners participating;   providing training for management and supervisory staff, incorporating the ncwwi’s  leadership academy for middle managers (lamm), leadership academy for  supervisors (las), and leadership academy for deans and directors (ladd);   5 of 54  providing plans that are proactive, strategic, collaborative, and sustainable for these  workforce projects; and   identifying and measuring improvements in clearly stated outcomes through a rigorous  evaluation.  the grantee may propose workforce projects that aim to assist a jurisdiction to assess their  workforce capacity in a number of domains. based on the identification of workforce needs in  its preliminary assessment, the grantee will propose a preliminary plan that identifies specific  activities that will be undertaken to address its critical workforce challenges. the ncwwi will  have the freedom to consider and propose a wide range of activities for inclusion in their  workforce projects. the ncwwi and its partner(s) may propose to develop a new approach to a  unique problem, identify existing best or promising practices they intend to use, and/or present a  model for selecting workforce interventions and implementing systemic change. workforce  projects will be developed and revised in consultation with cb after award of the cooperative  agreement and plans will not be implemented until they are approved by the assigned fpo.  (3) leadership training across the child welfare career spectrum  institutionalizing evidence-informed workforce practices and improving child welfare outcomes  requires leadership. leadership is needed to change vision, culture, beliefs, and to move the  organization to better practices.  cultivating leadership development across the child welfare  career spectrum is a critical aspect of ncwwi’s work.  activities for leadership training include:   providing learning opportunities for staff at the organizational intervention project sites  that builds upon the previously developed lamm, las, and ladd training. training  will focus on developing adaptive leadership and change management skills at all levels  of management in order for child welfare professionals to implement evidence-based  and evidence-informed workforce development initiatives and support healthy agency  culture and climate;   providing support for the transfer of learning and for sustainability through development  of a coaching program and the implementation of a train-the-trainer program for agency  internal capacity building; and   identifying and measuring improvements in clearly stated outcomes through a rigorous  evaluation.  (4) cross system approach to improve worker and child outcomes  public engagement and partnerships contribute to a healthy workforce.  activities for the cross system approach include:   designing and implementing a national educational campaign about the child welfare  system and its workforce to educate the public about the critical role and value of the  workforce. identifying a theme each year for the campaign and engaging with experts in  the field of messaging that culminates in a worker recognition day that coincides with  the celebration of national workforce development month in september; and   convening a national child welfare advisory board that will: (1) review ncwwi’s   6 of 54 approaches to university partnerships, leadership development, organizational  interventions, and the identification of child welfare best practices, and make  recommendations regarding strategies to address national workforce issues and provide  expert consultation to help build the capacity of the national child welfare workforce,  improve outcomes for children, and assist in the identification of best practices; and (2)  explore new and innovative ways of re-imagining the child welfare system’s service  design and delivery to: (a) better meet needs of the majority of families we serve who  are affected by neglect, (b)ensure staff  receives targeted education and training that  prepares them for effectively supporting these families, (c) recruit child welfare  applicants and utilize staff differently to reduce issues that contribute to worker  recruitment and retention, and (d) develop an agreed upon list of national child welfare  worker competencies for universities and child welfare agencies.  this advisory board  will consist of, but is not limited to, representatives from other cb-funded workforce  projects, the quality improvement center for tribes, the capacity building  collaborative, central and regional cb staff (as appropriate), state and tribal child  welfare agency leadership, state agency training directors, educational stakeholders  (university and community college), family partners, other child serving agencies, and  community representatives.  convening of this group must be frequent enough or  structured in such a way to allow the advisory group to develop, guide, review, and  provide recommendations throughout the 5-year period.  (5) knowledge development and management               as it implements the program activities and strategies, the ncwwi will develop, collect, store,  and manage a library of child welfare workforce development information.  activities for knowledge development and management include:    taking on new work that builds knowledge about evidence-based/informed practices in  child welfare workforce development;   collecting and disseminating current information on evidence-based/informed child  welfare workforce development strategies;   developing a structured knowledge management system to store and distribute  workforce development information; and   demonstrating expertise in new and innovative technologies for developing and  disseminating child welfare workforce information, including web ad mobile-based  technology.  evaluation  the grantee will design and implement a rigorous evaluation plan for all five program strategies  and activities of the ncwwi, listed above, under program and strategies activities.  program performance evaluation plan   the administration for children and families (acf) is committed to use the most rigorous  methods that are appropriate to the evaluation questions and feasible within budget and other  constraints.  the ncwwi will develop a rigorous evaluation design using multiple measures to  document and determine the effectiveness of the ncwwi's processes and major areas of   7 of 54 activity. the ncwwi is expected to employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in its  evaluation of process and outcome measures.  the grantee will have considerable flexibility to  implement an evaluation plan for the ncwwi that will contribute to and promote evidence- based strategies, practices, and programs.  the ncwwi's evaluation plan must include a  detailed description of both process and outcomes evaluation components.  evaluations can produce several types of evidence.  a learning organization with a culture of  continual improvement requires many types of evidence, including not only evaluation but also  descriptive research studies, performance measures, financial and cost data, survey statistics,  and approaches to using information, such as regular data-driven reviews of performance and  progress.  dissemination   cb expects that information and knowledge generated by these projects will be shared with the  field and efforts will be made to integrate project knowledge into policy and practice. the  grantee is expected to disseminate strategically and incorporate dissemination activities into  their work. the dissemination activities will focus on key target audiences, for specific  purposes, understanding what these target audiences need to know, and effectively getting this  information to them. the project will disseminate products and findings. the grantee will  evaluate the extent to which the target audiences have received project knowledge and used it as  intended, and assess the impact of dissemination. the grantee will allocate sufficient staff time  for dissemination.  the grantee will be expected to work throughout the course of this project with the fpo and cb  training/technical assistance (t/ta) providers to:   finalize dissemination goals and objectives;   identify and engage with target audiences for dissemination;   produce detailed procedures, materials, and other products based on the program  evaluation;   develop and disseminate summarized/synthesized information about the project.   produce a high-quality, comprehensive, final report suitable for archiving in the cb  discretionary grant library; and   ensure publications and websites are accessible. although not required, applicants are  strongly encouraged to consider using section 508 standards to ensure accessibility.  tasks to be performed by the ncwwi during the planning, implementation, and  sustainability phases   thoughtful planning is a necessary prerequisite to successful implementation of the  ncwwi’s activities.   the project must be fully functioning within 90 days following the notification of the  grant award.   while ongoing revision of implementation strategies may be appropriate later in the  project period, cb requires that initial planning phases for the workforce institute’s  major activity areas will be completed within 6 to 12 months following award.   the implementation phases for the ncwwi’s major activities will be 48 to 54 months  in duration.   8 of 54  during the final 6 months of the project, the ncwwi will compile evaluation data,  present findings, and prepare final reports to cb.   the grantee will plan in the budget for an annual face-to-face meeting with the fpo  including the evaluator and leadership from each of the major ncwwi components to  review the work that has taken place and plan for the next year.   the grantee will present preliminary plans for proposed planning, implementation, and  sustainability activities for each of the ncwwi's major activity areas. immediately after  the award and prior to implementation, the grantee's planning work plan will be subject  to review, revision, and final approval by cb.   the grantee is required to submit a design that clearly and concisely describes a strategy  for planning and implementing the ncwwi’s major components. these major  components are: university partnership to support workforce development; leadership  training across the child welfare career spectrum; organizational intervention to  improve workforce retention; cross system approach to improve worker and child  outcomes; and knowledge development and management.  due to the nature of its tasks, the ncwwi will not be required to organize all of its activities  into a single planning phase and subsequent implementation phase. for example, some of the  ncwwi's planning phases for cross-site evaluation are contingent upon the preparedness of  university partners to participate in the process of evaluation design.  the following do not  cover all of the key tasks but give guidance on approximate dates for specific activities.  grant activity/event   project period begins: september 30, 2018   planning phases begin for organization intervention projects:  october 1, 2018   lamm and las trainings begin :  march 2019   university partnership projects and organizational intervention projects selected:   may  2019   traineeship stipends awarded to students: august 2019   organizational intervention project implemented:  july  2019  a revised implementation plan for each of the workforce institute’s major component areas  will be due to cb within 10 months after the award of the cooperative agreement. grantees  must submit all performance indicator data, program, evaluation, and financial reports in a  timely manner (for more information, please see section vi.3. reporting).    ii. federal award information   funding instrument type: cooperative agreement    estimated total funding: $4,800,000    expected number of awards: 1    award ceiling: $4,800,000 per budget period    award floor: $3,000,000 per budget period    average projected award amount: $4,800,000 per budget period    anticipated project start date: 09/30/2018     9 of 54 length of project periods:    length of project period:  60-month project period with five 12- month budget periods   the initial award will be for a 12-month budget period. the award of continuation beyond each  12-month budget period will be subject to the availability of funds, the grantee’s compliance  with meeting the requirements of the foa and the cooperative agreement, and a determination  that continued funding would be in the best interest of the federal government.  in the first budget period, the maximum federal share of each project is not to exceed  $4,800,000. the estimated budget for subsequent budget periods will be the same. the projects  awarded will be for a project period of 60 months.    additional information on awards:   awards made under this announcement are subject to the availability of federal funds.    applications requesting an award amount that exceeds the award ceiling per budget period, or  per project period, as stated in this section, will be disqualified from competitive review and  from funding under this announcement. this disqualification applies only to the award  ceiling listed for the first 12-month budget period for projects with multiple budget periods. if  the project and budget period are the same, the disqualification applies to the award  ceiling listed for the project period. please see section iii.3. other, application  disqualification factors.    note: for those programs that require matching or cost sharing, recipients will be held  accountable for projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets  and budget justifications by budget period or by project period for fully funded awards, even if  the projected commitment exceeds the required amount of match or cost share. a recipient's  failure to provide the required matching amount may result in the disallowance of federal  funds. see section iii.2. of this announcement for information on cost-sharing or matching  requirements.         description of acf's anticipated substantial involvement under the cooperative  agreement    a cooperative agreement is a specific method of awarding federal assistance in which  substantial federal involvement is anticipated.  a cooperative agreement clearly defines the  respective responsibilities of cb and the awardee prior to the award. cb anticipates that agency  involvement will produce programmatic benefits to the recipient otherwise unavailable to them  for carrying out the project. the involvement and collaboration includes:  1. cb review and approval of planning stages of the activities before implementation  phases may begin;  2. cb and recipient joint collaboration in the performance of key programmatic activities  (i.e., strategic planning, implementation, information technology enhancements, t/ta,  publications or products, and evaluation);     10 of 54 3. close monitoring by cb of the requirements stated in this announcement that limit the  awardee's discretion with respect to scope of services offered; and  4. close monitoring by cb during performance which may, in order to ensure compliance  with the intent of this funding, exceed those federal stewardship responsibilities  customary for grant activities.  the ncwwi must partner closely with cb throughout the funding period to meet the goals of  this program announcement. as a participant in a cooperative agreement, the grantee can  expect to closely collaborate with cb in the review of its proposed activities. in some cases,  they will revise and jointly develop key project strategies. cb must approve project plans and  activities prior to implementation.    iii. eligibility information   iii.1. eligible applicants   eligible applicants are public or other nonprofit institutions of higher learning, including tribal  colleges. consortia of the eligible institutions of higher education are encouraged to apply, and  collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts are encouraged, but applications must identify a  primary applicant responsible for administering the grant. the primary applicant must be a  public or other nonprofit institution of higher learning.  applications from individuals (including sole proprietorships) and foreign entities are not  eligible and will be disqualified from competitive review and from funding under this  announcement. see section iii.3. other, application disqualification factors.      iii.2. cost sharing or matching   cost sharing / matching requirement: no   for all federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including  cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient’s cost  sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the criteria listed in 45 cfr 75.306.    for awards that require matching by statute, recipients will be held accountable for  projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget  justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards, even if the  projected commitment exceeds the amount required by the statutory match. a recipient’s  failure to provide the statutorily required matching amount may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.    for awards that do not require matching or cost sharing by statute, where “cost sharing”  refers to any situation in which the recipient voluntarily shares in the costs of a project other  than as statutorily required matching, recipients will be held accountable for projected  commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by   11 of 54 budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards. these include situations in which  contributions are voluntarily proposed by an applicant and are accepted by acf. non-federal  cost sharing will be included in the approved project budget so that the applicant will be held  accountable for proposed non-federal cost-sharing funds as shown in the notice of award  (noa). a recipient’s failure to provide voluntary cost sharing of non-federal resources  that have been accepted by acf as part of the approved project costs and that have been  shown as part of the approved project budget in the noa, may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.        iii.3. other     application disqualification factors   applications from individuals (including sole proprietorships) and foreign entities are not  eligible and will be disqualified from competitive review and from funding under this  announcement.    award ceiling

and received an exemption that will allow submission in paper format. see section iv.2.  application submission options for information about requesting an exemption.    electronic applications will only be accepted via www.grants.gov. acf will not accept  applications submitted via email or via facsimile.    each applicant is required to upload only two electronic files, excluding sfs and omb- approved forms.    file one: must contain the entire project description, and the budget and budget justification  (including a line-item budget and a budget narrative).    file two: must contain all documents required in the appendices.    adherence to the two-file requirement  no more than two files will be accepted for the review.  applications with additional files will  be amended and files will be removed from the review.  sfs and omb-approved forms will not  be considered additional files.      application upload requirements   acf strongly recommends that electronic applications be uploaded as portable document files  (pdfs). one file must contain the entire project description and budget justification; the other  file must contain all documents required in the appendices. details on the content of each of the  two files, as well as page limitations, are listed earlier in this section.    to adhere to the two-file requirement, applicants may need to convert and/or merge documents  together using a pdf converter software. many recent versions of microsoft office include the  ability to save documents to the pdf format without need of additional software. applicants  using the adobe professional software suite will be able to merge these documents together.   acf recommends merging documents electronically rather than scanning multiple documents  into one document manually, as scanned documents may have reduced clarity and readability.    applicants must ensure that the version of adobe professional they are using is compatible with  grants.gov. to verify adobe software compatibility please go to grants.gov and click on  “support” at the top bar menu and select “adobe software compatibility”, which is listed under  the topic “online answers.” the adobe verification process allows applicants to test their  version of the software by opening a test application package. grant.gov also includes guidance  on how to download a supported version of adobe, as well as troubleshooting instructions if an  applicant is unable to open the test application package.      17 of 54 the adobe software compatibility page located on grants.gov also provides guidance for  applicants that have received error messages while attempting to save an application package. it  also addresses local network and/or computer security settings and the impact this has on use of  adobe software.    required standard forms (sfs) and omb-approved forms  standard forms (sfs) and omb-approved forms, such as the sf-424 application and budget  forms and the sf-p/psl (project/performance site location), are uploaded separately at  grants.gov. these forms are submitted separately from the project description and appendices  files. see section iv.2. required forms, assurances, and certifications for the listing of  required standard forms, omb-approved forms, and required assurances and certifications.    naming application submission files  carefully observe the file naming conventions required by www.grants.gov. limit file  names to 50 characters (characters and spaces). special characters that are allowed under  grants.gov’s naming conventions, and are accommodated by acf’s systems, are listed in the  instructions available in the download application package at grants.gov. please also see  https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/submitting-utf-8-special-characters.html.    use only file formats supported by acf   it is critical that applicants submit applications using only the supported file formats listed here.  while acf supports all of the following file formats, we strongly recommend that the two  application submission files (project description and appendices) are uploaded as pdf  documents in order to comply with the two file upload limitation. documents in file formats  that are not supported by acf will be removed from the application and will not be used in the  competitive review. this may make the application incomplete and acf will not make any  awards based on an incomplete application.    acf supports the following file formats:   adobe pdf – portable document format (.pdf)   microsoft word (.doc or .docx)   microsoft excel (.xls or .xlsx)   microsoft powerpoint (.ppt)   corel wordperfect (.wpd)   image formats (.jpg, .gif, .tiff, or .bmp only)  do not encrypt or password-protect the electronic application files  if acf cannot access submitted electronic files because they are encrypted or password  protected, the affected file will be removed from the application and will not be reviewed. this  removal may make the application incomplete and acf will not make awards based on an  incomplete application.    formatting for paper application submissions:  the following requirements are only applicable to applications submitted in paper format.   18 of 54 applicants must receive an exemption from acf in order for a paper format application to be  accepted for review. for more information on the exemption, see \"acf policy on requesting an  exemption from required electronic application submission'\" at www.acf.hhs.gov/grants/  howto#chapter-6    format requirements for paper applications  all copies of mailed or hand-delivered paper applications must be submitted in a single  package. if an applicant is submitting multiple applications under a single foa, or multiple  applications under separate foas, each application submission must be packaged separately.  the package(s) must be clearly labeled for the specific foa it addresses by foa title and by  funding opportunity number (fon).    applicants using paper format should download the application forms package associated with  the foa's synopsis on www.grants.gov under the package tab.    because each application will be duplicated, do not use or include separate covers, binders,  clips, tabs, plastic inserts, maps, brochures, or any other items that cannot be processed easily  on a photocopy machine with an automatic feed. do not bind, clip, staple, or fasten in any way  separate sections of the application. applicants are advised that the copies of the application  submitted, not the original, will be reproduced by the federal government for review. all  application materials must be one-sided for duplication purposes. all pages in the  application submission must be sequentially numbered.    addresses for submission of paper applications  see section iv.7. other submission requirements for

be used during their planning activities to  revise their implementation plans and address anticipated implementation, logistical, and  administrative issues.  project timeline and milestones  provide quantitative monthly or quarterly projections of the accomplishments to be achieved for  each function, or activity, in such terms as the number of people to be served and the number of  activities accomplished. data may be organized and presented as project tasks and subtasks with  their corresponding timelines during the project period. for example, each project task could be  assigned to a row in the first column of a grid. then, a unit of time could be assigned to each  subsequent column, beginning with the first unit (i.e., week, month, quarter) of the project and  ending with the last.  shading, arrows, or other markings could be used across the applicable  grid boxes or cells, representing units of time, to indicate the approximate duration and/or  frequency of each task and its start and end dates within the project period.    when accomplishments cannot be quantified by activity or function, list them in chronological  order to show the schedule of accomplishments and their target dates.  program performance evaluation plan  applicants must describe the plan for the program performance evaluation that will contribute   25 of 54 to continuous quality improvement. the program performance evaluation should monitor  ongoing processes and the progress towards the goals and objectives of the project.  include  descriptions of the inputs (e.g., organizational

by the department of health  and human services (hhs) or another cognizant federal agency.    note: an applicant must enclose a copy of the current approved rate agreement.  if the applicant  is requesting a rate that is less than what is allowed under the program, the authorized  representative of the applicant organization must submit a signed acknowledgement that the  applicant is accepting a lower rate than allowed.    2) per 45 cfr  § 75.414(f) indirect (f&a) costs, “any non-federal entity [i.e., applicant]   31 of 54 that has never received a negotiated indirect costs rate, ... may elect to charge a de minimis  rate of 10%  of modified total direct costs (mtdc) which may be used indefinitely.   as  described in § 75.403, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs,  but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both.  if chosen, this  methodology once elected must be used consistently for all federal awards until such time  as a non-federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-federal entity may  apply to do at any time.”      justification:  this method only applies to applicants that have never received an approved  negotiated indirect cost rate from hhs or another cognizant federal agency.  applicants  awaiting approval of their indirect cost proposal may request the 10 percent de minimis rate.   when the applicant chooses this method, costs included in the indirect cost pool must not be  charged as direct costs to the grant.  commitment of non-federal resources  description: amounts of non-federal resources that will be used to support the project as  identified in block 18 of the sf-424.    for all federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including  cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient’s cost  sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the criteria listed in 45 cfr § 75.306.     for awards that require matching by statute, recipients will be held accountable for  projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget  justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards, even if the  projected commitment exceeds the amount required by the statutory match. a recipient’s  failure to provide the statutorily required matching amount may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.     for awards that do not require matching or cost sharing by statute, where “cost sharing”  refers to any situation in which the recipient voluntarily shares in the costs of a project other  than as statutorily required matching, recipients will be held accountable for projected  commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by  budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards . these include situations in which  contributions are voluntarily proposed by an applicant and are accepted by acf. non-federal  cost sharing will be included in the approved project budget so that the applicant will be held  accountable for proposed non-federal cost-sharing funds as shown in the notice of award  (noa). a recipient’s failure to provide voluntary cost sharing of non-federal resources  that have been accepted by acf as part of the approved project costs and that have been  shown as part of the approved project budget in the noa, may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.     justification: if an applicant is relying on match from a third party, then a firm commitment of   32 of 54 these resources (letter(s) or other documentation) is required to be submitted with the  application. detailed budget information must be provided for every funding source identified  in item18. \"estimated funding ($)\" on the sf-424.     applicants are required to fully identify and document in their applications the specific costs or  contributions they propose in order to meet a matching requirement. applicants are also  required to provide documentation in their applications on the sources of funding or  contribution(s). in-kind contributions must be accompanied by a justification of how the stated  valuation was determined. matching or cost sharing must be documented by budget period (or  by project period for fully funded awards). a recipient’s failure to provide a statutorily  required matching amount may result in the disallowance of federal funds.    applications that lack the required supporting documentation will not be disqualified from  competitive review; however, it may impact an application’s scoring under the evaluation  criteria in section v.1. of this announcement.    paperwork reduction disclaimer  as required by the paperwork reduction act of 1995, 44 u.s.c. §§ 3501-3521, the public  reporting burden for the project description and budget/budget justification is estimated to  average 60 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and  maintaining the data needed, and reviewing the collection information. the project description  and budget/budget justification information collection is approved under omb control number  0970-0139, expiration date is 01/31/2019. an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person  is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid  omb control number.        application submission options   electronic submission via www.grants.gov   this section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for acf program  applications. please read the following instructions carefully and completely.    electronic delivery  acf is participating in the grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site  to find and apply for grant funding opportunities. acf applicants are required to submit their  applications online through grants.gov.    how to register and apply through grants.gov  read the following instructions about registering to apply for acf funds. applicants should read  the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the  registration process. reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the  registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information.    the registration process can take up to four weeks to complete. therefore, registration should be   33 of 54 done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact your ability to meet required application  submission deadlines.    organization applicants can find complete instructions here:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration.html    obtain a duns number: all entities applying for funding, including renewal funding, must  have a data universal numbering system (duns) number from dun & bradstreet (d&b).  applicants must enter the duns number in the data entry field labeled \"organizations  duns\" on the sf-424 form.    for more detailed instructions for obtaining a duns number, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration/step-1-obtain-duns- number.html    register with sam: in addition to having a duns number, organizations applying online  through grants.gov must register with the system for award management (sam). all  organizations must register with sam in order to apply online. failure to register with sam  will prevent your organization from applying through grants.gov.    for more detailed instructions for registering with sam, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration/step-2-register-with- sam.html    create a grants.gov account: the next step in the registration process is to create an  account with grants.gov. applicants must know their organization's duns number to  complete this process. completing this process automatically triggers an email request for  applicant roles to the organization's e-business point of contact (ebiz poc) for review. the  ebiz poc is a representative from your organization who is the contact listed for sam. to  apply for grants on behalf of your organization, you will need the aor role.    for more detailed instructions about creating a profile on grants.gov, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration.html    authorize grants.gov roles: after creating an account on grants.gov, the ebiz poc  receives an email notifying them of your registration and request for roles. the ebiz poc  will then log in to grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the  aor role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of  your organization. you will be able to submit your application online any time after you  have been approved as an aor.    for more detailed instructions about creating a profile on grants.gov. refer to:  https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize-roles.html    track role status: to track your role request, refer to:    34 of 54 https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track-role-status.html    when applications are submitted through grants.gov, the name of the organization's aor that  submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the  electronic signature. the ebiz poc must authorize individuals who are able to make legally  binding commitment on behalf of the organization as an aor; this step is often missed and it is  crucial for valid and timely submissions.    how to submit an application to acf via grants.gov  grants.gov applicants can apply online using workspace. workspace is a shared, online  environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different  webforms within an application. for each foa, you can create individual instances of a  workspace.    the following is an overview of applying via grants.gov. for access to complete instructions on  how to apply for opportunities, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/apply-for- grants.html   create a workspace: creating a workspace allows you to complete an application online  and route it through your organization for review before submitting.    complete a workspace: add participants to the workspace, complete all the required forms,  and check for errors before submission.  adobe reader: if you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download  individual pdf forms in workspace so that they will appear similar to other standard or  acf forms. the individual pdf forms can be downloaded and saved to your local  device storage, network drive(s), or external drive(s), then accessed through adobe  reader.    note: visit the adobe software compatibility page on grants.gov to download the  appropriate version of the software at:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe-software-compatibility.html    mandatory fields in forms: in the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk  and a different background color. these fields are mandatory fields that must be  completed to successfully submit your application.    complete sf-424 fields first: the forms are designed to fill in common required  fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and duns number. to  trigger this feature, an applicant must complete the sf-424 information first. once it is  completed, the information will transfer to the other forms.  submit a workspace: an application may be submitted through workspace by clicking the  sign and submit button on the manage workspace page, under the forms tab. grants.gov  recommends submitting your application at least 24-48 hours prior to the close date to  provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the   35 of 54 application submission.    track a workspace: after successfully submitting a workspace package, a grants.gov  tracking number (grantxxxxxxxx) is automatically assigned to the package. the  number will be listed on the confirmation page that is generated after submission.  for additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/applicant-training.html    grants.gov provides applicants 24/7 support via the toll-free number 1-800-518-4726 and email  at support@grants.gov. for questions related to the specific grant opportunity, contact the number  listed in the application package of the grant you are applying for.    if you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the grants.gov support  center and get a ticket number. the support center ticket number will assist acf with tracking  your issue and understanding background information on the issue.    timely receipt requirements and proof of timely submission  all applications must be received by 11:59 p.m., et, on the due date established for each  program. proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by grants.gov. an electronic  date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by  grants.gov. the applicant aor will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking  number (grantxxxxxxxx) from grants.gov with the successful transmission of their  application. applicant aors will also receive the official date/stamp and grants.gov tracking  number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission.    when acf successfully retrieves the application from grants.gov, and acknowledges the  download of submission, grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the  application to the email address of the applicant with the aor role. again, proof of timely  submission shall be the official date and time that grants.gov receives your application.  applications received by grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be  considered late and will not be considered for funding by acf.    applicants with slow internet, such as dial-up connections, should be aware that transmission can  take some time before grants.gov receives your application. again, grants.gov will provide  either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant  with the aor role. the grants.gov support center reports that some applicants end the  transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. please  be patient and give the system time to process the application.    issues with federal systems  for any systems issues experienced with grants.gov or sam.gov, please refer to acf’s “policy  for applicants experiencing federal systems issues” document for complete guidance  at

at sam  (www.sam.gov). see section iv.3. unique entity identifier and system for award management  (sam).    initial acf screening  each application will be screened to determine whether it meets any of the disqualification  factors described in section iii.3.other, application disqualification factors.    disqualified applications are considered to be “non-responsive” and are excluded from the  competitive review process. applicants will be notified of a disqualification determination by  email or by usps postal mail within 30 federal business days from the closing date of this  foa.    objective review and results  applications competing for financial assistance will be reviewed and evaluated by objective  review panels using only the criteria described in section v.1. criteria of this announcement.  each panel is composed of experts with knowledge and experience in the area under review.  generally, review panels include three reviewers and one chairperson.    results of the competitive objective review are taken into consideration by acf in the selection  of projects for funding; however, objective review scores and rankings are not binding. scores  and rankings are only one element used in the award decision-making process.     acf may elect not to fund applicants with management or financial problems that would  indicate an inability to successfully complete the proposed project. applications may be funded   45 of 54 in whole or in part. successful applicants may be funded at an amount lower than that  requested. acf reserves the right to consider preferences to fund organizations serving  emerging, unserved, or under-served populations, including those populations located in  pockets of poverty. acf will also consider the geographic distribution of federal funds in its  award decisions.  acf may refuse funding for projects with what it regards as unreasonably high start-up costs  for facilities or equipment, or for projects with unreasonably

program for experienced child welfare supervisors.   the core curriculum  consists of six online modules each followed by a face-to-face or webinar activity (leadership  academy for supervisors learning network or lasln) where participants can network with  facilitators and other learners to discuss and reinforce what has been covered in the previous  module.  the core curriculum provides 30 contact hours of training and includes two tracks:  a  personal learning plan to develop leadership skills and a change initiative project to contribute  to a systems change within the agency.  the las provides a high quality, proven training  experience for experienced supervisors in an accessible format, two-thirds in a self-directed  approach to meet supervisors? busy schedule.  it is an opportunity to develop a leadership  pipeline in the agency, providing professional development, succession planning and  contributing to the agency?s strategic plan.   the las will provide:   access to the online curriculum hosted on las servers     consultation and training on implementing the las     website administrative/trainer rights for agency staff to monitor participants and edit  agency specific areas of the las   agency-specific standardized reports to assist in tracking participation of the trainees   communication and support to address and resolve implementation issues     access to the latest leadership and workforce development resources  the las online learning modules and curriculum can be found at: http://ncwwi.org/index.php /national-las-core-training  ncwwi organizational intervention   ncwwi?s organizational intervention component promotes organizational change by using  three major strategies: (1) solution-focused design teams as the ?engine for innovation,? (2)  consistent leadership engagement, and (3) development of successful structures for   54 of 54 organization-wide communication, dissemination, adoption, and implementation.  the  organizational intervention is part of a workforce excellence approach that includes deliveries  of las, lamm, and ladd in jurisdictions that also have a university partnership (up)  program.  currently, the organizational intervention operates in san francisco city/county and  the states of missouri and indiana.  the model is derived from extensive research and provides a high quality, proven approach to  implement an organizational change initiative. the synergistic approach with up, ladd, las,  and lamm concentrate training and implementation efforts at levels appropriate to the role of  directors, managers and supervisors, as well as university faculty, while engaging all staff in the  change initiative. it is an opportunity to develop a positive procedure for aligning operational  principles during innovation, provide professional development, and improve the workforce  environment.  the organizational intervention activities include:     identifying specific factors that impede and advance organizational change    providing a facilitator for design team support, team training and direction   employing the phase model for successful, sustainable implementation    o phase i: organizational environment assessments    o phase ii: adoption of the change initiative    o phase iii: implementation  o phase iv: sustainability and evaluation  more information about the ncwwi organizational intervention can be found at: http://ncwwi .org/index.php/teams-services/organizational-intervention  leading information-sharing networks, knowledge management and dissemination    the elements of knowledge management, peer exchange and dissemination are seamlessly  integrated in ncwwi?s comprehensive approach to workforce systems development through  the leading information-sharing networks, knowledge management and dissemination team,  which works to connect our partners, participants, and a national child welfare audience to best  and evidence-informed workforce and leadership development practices through a wide variety  of offerings such as an innovative use of web (www.myncwwi.org) and mobile technology  (facebook, linkedin, twitter).                    administration for children and families       administration on children, youth and families -

stephanie tubbs jones child welfare services program, section  426 (a)(1)(c) of the social security act [42 u.s.c. 626 (a)(1)(c)]    description    2 of 54 background    acyf and the children’s bureau  within the administration for children and families (acf) and the administration on  children, youth and families (acyf), the children's bureau (cb) plans, manages, coordinates,  and supports child abuse and neglect prevention, and child welfare services programs. cb is the  agency within the federal government that is responsible for assisting child welfare systems by  promoting continuous improvement in the delivery of child welfare services. cb programs are  designed to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of all children and youth, including  those in foster care, available for adoption, recently adopted, abused, neglected, dependent,  disabled, or homeless, and to prevent the neglect, abuse, and exploitation of children. (for more  information about cb's programs, visit http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb).  the role of workforce development initiatives  workforce development initiatives in the field of child welfare is critical. a goal of cb  throughout much of its history has been to ensure that the workforce in public child welfare  within both states and tribes is educated and trained to perform the difficult task of working  with families and children who have been neglected and/or abused. while there has been  positive movement in understanding how to best meet the needs of children and families in the  child welfare system, the long-standing issue of recruiting, preparing, and retaining adequate  numbers of child welfare staff continues to be a problem for child welfare agencies (state,  county, and tribal). while lack of a qualified applicant pool and issues of staff turnover have  been recognized as a widespread problem for years, its impact on child welfare practice  outcomes has not been carefully examined until recently. over time, it has become clear that  even basic improvements in child welfare practice and outcomes for children and families  involved with child welfare will not be realized without improvements in the child welfare  workforce.  cb intends to continue a multi-pronged approach to building the capacity of the child welfare  workforce, building upon the lessons learned through previous cb workforce initiatives:  1. those who provide front line services to children, youth, and families must be recruited,  educated, trained, supported, and developed professionally in innovative ways. building  the child welfare workforce requires people with excellent skills doing high-quality  work.  2. agencies must improve their organizational cultures if they intend to retain their  workforce and achieve better outcomes for children, youth, and families. cb wishes to  support healthy child welfare organizations that value their people, support best  practices in case management, provide evidence-based and evidence-informed  interventions in treatment and hospitable environments, and effectively collaborate with  partner agencies to ensure that children, youth, and families are safe, healing, and  thriving.  3. academic partners must include in their curriculum the content knowledge that will  teach the wide array of skills needed to prepare high-quality professionals in child  welfare.  in the academies that train and in agencies that serve, the desired result is to  support the workforce to promote the physical safety, and social and emotional well-  3 of 54 being of children and families.  additional information regarding cb's previous ncwwi work and an overview of the current  ncwwi project and its various components can be found in the appendix section.  project requirements  target population  the target population for this grant is a varied and diverse group, including members of the  state and tribal child welfare workforce (from agency directors to public child welfare  professionals directly serving children and families),  prospective child welfare professionals  who are pursuing social work degrees, child welfare faculty, and deans and directors of schools  of social work.  collaboration  in addition to its partnership with cb  (for more information, see section ii. federal award  information, description of acf’s anticipated substantial involvement under the cooperative  agreement), the grantee will be responsible for collaborating with other federal projects,  including, but not limited to, capacity building center for states, the capacity building center  for tribes, the capacity building center for courts, the child welfare information gateway,  the quality improvement center on workforce development, and other cb-funded and federal  interagency projects aimed at increasing the capacity of the workforce to meet the needs of  children and families.  outreach and engagement  in order to successfully reach its target audiences and achieve its goals for participation and use  of ncwwi tools and resources, the grantee must have clear and deliberate strategies for  outreach and engagement. the ncwwi must engage its intended consumers in the  development and refinement of its training activities and products. the project will seek  feedback from members of its target audience(s) throughout the project period to better  understand workforce development needs, inform project activities, review curricula and  product-related content, and proposed dissemination strategies.  program strategies and activities    (1) university partnership projects  the ncwwi will allocate funding for traineeship projects in partnership with other public  and/or nonprofit institutions of higher education with accredited social work education  programs. these 5-year projects will support professional education for current or prospective  child welfare practitioners who are currently enrolled or who plan to enroll in a bachelor or  master social work program. a minimum of ten traineeship projects shall be identified,  selected, and administered in partnership with eligible institutions of higher education. these  projects will include direct stipends to students, administration of the stipends, participation in a  cross-site evaluation, and provision of additional support services for students that will increase  the likelihood of traineeship completion and retention of graduates in the field of child welfare.  required assurances and evidence of compliance for stipend recipients can be found at section  426(c) of the social security act.  for more information on these assurances, please see section  iv.2 content and form of application submission, required forms, assurances, and   4 of 54 certifications.  activities for university partnership projects include:   identifying, selecting, and administering traineeship projects for local, professional  educational traineeships through a stipend/scholar program;   implementing an educational program that increases the knowledge and skills and  leadership capacity of individual stipend recipients to address the social and emotional  needs of children, youth, and families served by child welfare agencies;   developing and/or enhancing child welfare curricula on the developmental and  functional consequences of trauma (for children, youth, and workers) and evidence- based practices to increase stipend recipients skill level, professional practice and  leadership ability, and to support retention in the child welfare workforce;   implementing an organizational intervention component linking the school of social  work with the local public child welfare agency. the partnership will include  exploration of innovative approaches to preparation for child welfare work as well as a  strong transition from school to work approach demonstrating effectiveness in  supporting retention of qualified, competent staff;   tailoring organizational interventions to the specific needs of the local public child  welfare agency and employing a strong evaluation component; and   implementing traineeships as early as possible during the first fiscal year of the  cooperative   agreement, at least prior to the start of the academic year in the fall of 2019.  (2) organizational interventions to improve workforce recruitment and retention  the ncwwi organizational interventions are expected to confront issues related to staff  recruitment, training, supervision, management, and retention. all of the workforce strategies  that the grantee and its partner(s) choose to pursue must be consistent with both the guiding  principles of this foa and with the applicable agency’s mission. an important objective of this  partnership will be to assist the agency in sustaining its systemic change initiative and to  integrate its staff recruitment and retention approaches into the agency’s strategic plan.  activities for organizational interventions include:   selecting and engaging with five to seven state or tribal child welfare agencies through  binding memoranda of agreements (moas) that clearly lay out the roles,  responsibilities, and expectations of both parties to implement an innovative,  comprehensive, and integrated organizational, educational, and professional  development approach to effective child welfare agency workforce development  building upon the last two iterations of ncwwi work;   selecting organizational interventions through the process of a comprehensive  assessment of the recruitment, training, and retention system of the child welfare  agency, and implementing interventions through the use of a design team or other  teaming approach with appropriate internal and external partners participating;   providing training for management and supervisory staff, incorporating the ncwwi’s  leadership academy for middle managers (lamm), leadership academy for  supervisors (las), and leadership academy for deans and directors (ladd);   5 of 54  providing plans that are proactive, strategic, collaborative, and sustainable for these  workforce projects; and   identifying and measuring improvements in clearly stated outcomes through a rigorous  evaluation.  the grantee may propose workforce projects that aim to assist a jurisdiction to assess their  workforce capacity in a number of domains. based on the identification of workforce needs in  its preliminary assessment, the grantee will propose a preliminary plan that identifies specific  activities that will be undertaken to address its critical workforce challenges. the ncwwi will  have the freedom to consider and propose a wide range of activities for inclusion in their  workforce projects. the ncwwi and its partner(s) may propose to develop a new approach to a  unique problem, identify existing best or promising practices they intend to use, and/or present a  model for selecting workforce interventions and implementing systemic change. workforce  projects will be developed and revised in consultation with cb after award of the cooperative  agreement and plans will not be implemented until they are approved by the assigned fpo.  (3) leadership training across the child welfare career spectrum  institutionalizing evidence-informed workforce practices and improving child welfare outcomes  requires leadership. leadership is needed to change vision, culture, beliefs, and to move the  organization to better practices.  cultivating leadership development across the child welfare  career spectrum is a critical aspect of ncwwi’s work.  activities for leadership training include:   providing learning opportunities for staff at the organizational intervention project sites  that builds upon the previously developed lamm, las, and ladd training. training  will focus on developing adaptive leadership and change management skills at all levels  of management in order for child welfare professionals to implement evidence-based  and evidence-informed workforce development initiatives and support healthy agency  culture and climate;   providing support for the transfer of learning and for sustainability through development  of a coaching program and the implementation of a train-the-trainer program for agency  internal capacity building; and   identifying and measuring improvements in clearly stated outcomes through a rigorous  evaluation.  (4) cross system approach to improve worker and child outcomes  public engagement and partnerships contribute to a healthy workforce.  activities for the cross system approach include:   designing and implementing a national educational campaign about the child welfare  system and its workforce to educate the public about the critical role and value of the  workforce. identifying a theme each year for the campaign and engaging with experts in  the field of messaging that culminates in a worker recognition day that coincides with  the celebration of national workforce development month in september; and   convening a national child welfare advisory board that will: (1) review ncwwi’s   6 of 54 approaches to university partnerships, leadership development, organizational  interventions, and the identification of child welfare best practices, and make  recommendations regarding strategies to address national workforce issues and provide  expert consultation to help build the capacity of the national child welfare workforce,  improve outcomes for children, and assist in the identification of best practices; and (2)  explore new and innovative ways of re-imagining the child welfare system’s service  design and delivery to: (a) better meet needs of the majority of families we serve who  are affected by neglect, (b)ensure staff  receives targeted education and training that  prepares them for effectively supporting these families, (c) recruit child welfare  applicants and utilize staff differently to reduce issues that contribute to worker  recruitment and retention, and (d) develop an agreed upon list of national child welfare  worker competencies for universities and child welfare agencies.  this advisory board  will consist of, but is not limited to, representatives from other cb-funded workforce  projects, the quality improvement center for tribes, the capacity building  collaborative, central and regional cb staff (as appropriate), state and tribal child  welfare agency leadership, state agency training directors, educational stakeholders  (university and community college), family partners, other child serving agencies, and  community representatives.  convening of this group must be frequent enough or  structured in such a way to allow the advisory group to develop, guide, review, and  provide recommendations throughout the 5-year period.  (5) knowledge development and management               as it implements the program activities and strategies, the ncwwi will develop, collect, store,  and manage a library of child welfare workforce development information.  activities for knowledge development and management include:    taking on new work that builds knowledge about evidence-based/informed practices in  child welfare workforce development;   collecting and disseminating current information on evidence-based/informed child  welfare workforce development strategies;   developing a structured knowledge management system to store and distribute  workforce development information; and   demonstrating expertise in new and innovative technologies for developing and  disseminating child welfare workforce information, including web ad mobile-based  technology.  evaluation  the grantee will design and implement a rigorous evaluation plan for all five program strategies  and activities of the ncwwi, listed above, under program and strategies activities.  program performance evaluation plan   the administration for children and families (acf) is committed to use the most rigorous  methods that are appropriate to the evaluation questions and feasible within budget and other  constraints.  the ncwwi will develop a rigorous evaluation design using multiple measures to  document and determine the effectiveness of the ncwwi's processes and major areas of   7 of 54 activity. the ncwwi is expected to employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in its  evaluation of process and outcome measures.  the grantee will have considerable flexibility to  implement an evaluation plan for the ncwwi that will contribute to and promote evidence- based strategies, practices, and programs.  the ncwwi's evaluation plan must include a  detailed description of both process and outcomes evaluation components.  evaluations can produce several types of evidence.  a learning organization with a culture of  continual improvement requires many types of evidence, including not only evaluation but also  descriptive research studies, performance measures, financial and cost data, survey statistics,  and approaches to using information, such as regular data-driven reviews of performance and  progress.  dissemination   cb expects that information and knowledge generated by these projects will be shared with the  field and efforts will be made to integrate project knowledge into policy and practice. the  grantee is expected to disseminate strategically and incorporate dissemination activities into  their work. the dissemination activities will focus on key target audiences, for specific  purposes, understanding what these target audiences need to know, and effectively getting this  information to them. the project will disseminate products and findings. the grantee will  evaluate the extent to which the target audiences have received project knowledge and used it as  intended, and assess the impact of dissemination. the grantee will allocate sufficient staff time  for dissemination.  the grantee will be expected to work throughout the course of this project with the fpo and cb  training/technical assistance (t/ta) providers to:   finalize dissemination goals and objectives;   identify and engage with target audiences for dissemination;   produce detailed procedures, materials, and other products based on the program  evaluation;   develop and disseminate summarized/synthesized information about the project.   produce a high-quality, comprehensive, final report suitable for archiving in the cb  discretionary grant library; and   ensure publications and websites are accessible. although not required, applicants are  strongly encouraged to consider using section 508 standards to ensure accessibility.  tasks to be performed by the ncwwi during the planning, implementation, and  sustainability phases   thoughtful planning is a necessary prerequisite to successful implementation of the  ncwwi’s activities.   the project must be fully functioning within 90 days following the notification of the  grant award.   while ongoing revision of implementation strategies may be appropriate later in the  project period, cb requires that initial planning phases for the workforce institute’s  major activity areas will be completed within 6 to 12 months following award.   the implementation phases for the ncwwi’s major activities will be 48 to 54 months  in duration.   8 of 54  during the final 6 months of the project, the ncwwi will compile evaluation data,  present findings, and prepare final reports to cb.   the grantee will plan in the budget for an annual face-to-face meeting with the fpo  including the evaluator and leadership from each of the major ncwwi components to  review the work that has taken place and plan for the next year.   the grantee will present preliminary plans for proposed planning, implementation, and  sustainability activities for each of the ncwwi's major activity areas. immediately after  the award and prior to implementation, the grantee's planning work plan will be subject  to review, revision, and final approval by cb.   the grantee is required to submit a design that clearly and concisely describes a strategy  for planning and implementing the ncwwi’s major components. these major  components are: university partnership to support workforce development; leadership  training across the child welfare career spectrum; organizational intervention to  improve workforce retention; cross system approach to improve worker and child  outcomes; and knowledge development and management.  due to the nature of its tasks, the ncwwi will not be required to organize all of its activities  into a single planning phase and subsequent implementation phase. for example, some of the  ncwwi's planning phases for cross-site evaluation are contingent upon the preparedness of  university partners to participate in the process of evaluation design.  the following do not  cover all of the key tasks but give guidance on approximate dates for specific activities.  grant activity/event   project period begins: september 30, 2018   planning phases begin for organization intervention projects:  october 1, 2018   lamm and las trainings begin :  march 2019   university partnership projects and organizational intervention projects selected:   may  2019   traineeship stipends awarded to students: august 2019   organizational intervention project implemented:  july  2019  a revised implementation plan for each of the workforce institute’s major component areas  will be due to cb within 10 months after the award of the cooperative agreement. grantees  must submit all performance indicator data, program, evaluation, and financial reports in a  timely manner (for more information, please see section vi.3. reporting).    ii. federal award information   funding instrument type: cooperative agreement    estimated total funding: $4,800,000    expected number of awards: 1    award ceiling: $4,800,000 per budget period    award floor: $3,000,000 per budget period    average projected award amount: $4,800,000 per budget period    anticipated project start date: 09/30/2018     9 of 54 length of project periods:    length of project period:  60-month project period with five 12- month budget periods   the initial award will be for a 12-month budget period. the award of continuation beyond each  12-month budget period will be subject to the availability of funds, the grantee’s compliance  with meeting the requirements of the foa and the cooperative agreement, and a determination  that continued funding would be in the best interest of the federal government.  in the first budget period, the maximum federal share of each project is not to exceed  $4,800,000. the estimated budget for subsequent budget periods will be the same. the projects  awarded will be for a project period of 60 months.    additional information on awards:   awards made under this announcement are subject to the availability of federal funds.    applications requesting an award amount that exceeds the award ceiling per budget period, or  per project period, as stated in this section, will be disqualified from competitive review and  from funding under this announcement. this disqualification applies only to the award  ceiling listed for the first 12-month budget period for projects with multiple budget periods. if  the project and budget period are the same, the disqualification applies to the award  ceiling listed for the project period. please see section iii.3. other, application  disqualification factors.    note: for those programs that require matching or cost sharing, recipients will be held  accountable for projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets  and budget justifications by budget period or by project period for fully funded awards, even if  the projected commitment exceeds the required amount of match or cost share. a recipient's  failure to provide the required matching amount may result in the disallowance of federal  funds. see section iii.2. of this announcement for information on cost-sharing or matching  requirements.         description of acf's anticipated substantial involvement under the cooperative  agreement    a cooperative agreement is a specific method of awarding federal assistance in which  substantial federal involvement is anticipated.  a cooperative agreement clearly defines the  respective responsibilities of cb and the awardee prior to the award. cb anticipates that agency  involvement will produce programmatic benefits to the recipient otherwise unavailable to them  for carrying out the project. the involvement and collaboration includes:  1. cb review and approval of planning stages of the activities before implementation  phases may begin;  2. cb and recipient joint collaboration in the performance of key programmatic activities  (i.e., strategic planning, implementation, information technology enhancements, t/ta,  publications or products, and evaluation);     10 of 54 3. close monitoring by cb of the requirements stated in this announcement that limit the  awardee's discretion with respect to scope of services offered; and  4. close monitoring by cb during performance which may, in order to ensure compliance  with the intent of this funding, exceed those federal stewardship responsibilities  customary for grant activities.  the ncwwi must partner closely with cb throughout the funding period to meet the goals of  this program announcement. as a participant in a cooperative agreement, the grantee can  expect to closely collaborate with cb in the review of its proposed activities. in some cases,  they will revise and jointly develop key project strategies. cb must approve project plans and  activities prior to implementation.    iii. eligibility information   iii.1. eligible applicants   eligible applicants are public or other nonprofit institutions of higher learning, including tribal  colleges. consortia of the eligible institutions of higher education are encouraged to apply, and  collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts are encouraged, but applications must identify a  primary applicant responsible for administering the grant. the primary applicant must be a  public or other nonprofit institution of higher learning.  applications from individuals (including sole proprietorships) and foreign entities are not  eligible and will be disqualified from competitive review and from funding under this  announcement. see section iii.3. other, application disqualification factors.      iii.2. cost sharing or matching   cost sharing / matching requirement: no   for all federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including  cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient’s cost  sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the criteria listed in 45 cfr 75.306.    for awards that require matching by statute, recipients will be held accountable for  projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget  justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards, even if the  projected commitment exceeds the amount required by the statutory match. a recipient’s  failure to provide the statutorily required matching amount may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.    for awards that do not require matching or cost sharing by statute, where “cost sharing”  refers to any situation in which the recipient voluntarily shares in the costs of a project other  than as statutorily required matching, recipients will be held accountable for projected  commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by   11 of 54 budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards. these include situations in which  contributions are voluntarily proposed by an applicant and are accepted by acf. non-federal  cost sharing will be included in the approved project budget so that the applicant will be held  accountable for proposed non-federal cost-sharing funds as shown in the notice of award  (noa). a recipient’s failure to provide voluntary cost sharing of non-federal resources  that have been accepted by acf as part of the approved project costs and that have been  shown as part of the approved project budget in the noa, may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.        iii.3. other     application disqualification factors   applications from individuals (including sole proprietorships) and foreign entities are not  eligible and will be disqualified from competitive review and from funding under this  announcement.    award ceiling

and received an exemption that will allow submission in paper format. see section iv.2.  application submission options for information about requesting an exemption.    electronic applications will only be accepted via www.grants.gov. acf will not accept  applications submitted via email or via facsimile.    each applicant is required to upload only two electronic files, excluding sfs and omb- approved forms.    file one: must contain the entire project description, and the budget and budget justification  (including a line-item budget and a budget narrative).    file two: must contain all documents required in the appendices.    adherence to the two-file requirement  no more than two files will be accepted for the review.  applications with additional files will  be amended and files will be removed from the review.  sfs and omb-approved forms will not  be considered additional files.      application upload requirements   acf strongly recommends that electronic applications be uploaded as portable document files  (pdfs). one file must contain the entire project description and budget justification; the other  file must contain all documents required in the appendices. details on the content of each of the  two files, as well as page limitations, are listed earlier in this section.    to adhere to the two-file requirement, applicants may need to convert and/or merge documents  together using a pdf converter software. many recent versions of microsoft office include the  ability to save documents to the pdf format without need of additional software. applicants  using the adobe professional software suite will be able to merge these documents together.   acf recommends merging documents electronically rather than scanning multiple documents  into one document manually, as scanned documents may have reduced clarity and readability.    applicants must ensure that the version of adobe professional they are using is compatible with  grants.gov. to verify adobe software compatibility please go to grants.gov and click on  “support” at the top bar menu and select “adobe software compatibility”, which is listed under  the topic “online answers.” the adobe verification process allows applicants to test their  version of the software by opening a test application package. grant.gov also includes guidance  on how to download a supported version of adobe, as well as troubleshooting instructions if an  applicant is unable to open the test application package.      17 of 54 the adobe software compatibility page located on grants.gov also provides guidance for  applicants that have received error messages while attempting to save an application package. it  also addresses local network and/or computer security settings and the impact this has on use of  adobe software.    required standard forms (sfs) and omb-approved forms  standard forms (sfs) and omb-approved forms, such as the sf-424 application and budget  forms and the sf-p/psl (project/performance site location), are uploaded separately at  grants.gov. these forms are submitted separately from the project description and appendices  files. see section iv.2. required forms, assurances, and certifications for the listing of  required standard forms, omb-approved forms, and required assurances and certifications.    naming application submission files  carefully observe the file naming conventions required by www.grants.gov. limit file  names to 50 characters (characters and spaces). special characters that are allowed under  grants.gov’s naming conventions, and are accommodated by acf’s systems, are listed in the  instructions available in the download application package at grants.gov. please also see  https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/submitting-utf-8-special-characters.html.    use only file formats supported by acf   it is critical that applicants submit applications using only the supported file formats listed here.  while acf supports all of the following file formats, we strongly recommend that the two  application submission files (project description and appendices) are uploaded as pdf  documents in order to comply with the two file upload limitation. documents in file formats  that are not supported by acf will be removed from the application and will not be used in the  competitive review. this may make the application incomplete and acf will not make any  awards based on an incomplete application.    acf supports the following file formats:   adobe pdf – portable document format (.pdf)   microsoft word (.doc or .docx)   microsoft excel (.xls or .xlsx)   microsoft powerpoint (.ppt)   corel wordperfect (.wpd)   image formats (.jpg, .gif, .tiff, or .bmp only)  do not encrypt or password-protect the electronic application files  if acf cannot access submitted electronic files because they are encrypted or password  protected, the affected file will be removed from the application and will not be reviewed. this  removal may make the application incomplete and acf will not make awards based on an  incomplete application.    formatting for paper application submissions:  the following requirements are only applicable to applications submitted in paper format.   18 of 54 applicants must receive an exemption from acf in order for a paper format application to be  accepted for review. for more information on the exemption, see \"acf policy on requesting an  exemption from required electronic application submission'\" at www.acf.hhs.gov/grants/  howto#chapter-6    format requirements for paper applications  all copies of mailed or hand-delivered paper applications must be submitted in a single  package. if an applicant is submitting multiple applications under a single foa, or multiple  applications under separate foas, each application submission must be packaged separately.  the package(s) must be clearly labeled for the specific foa it addresses by foa title and by  funding opportunity number (fon).    applicants using paper format should download the application forms package associated with  the foa's synopsis on www.grants.gov under the package tab.    because each application will be duplicated, do not use or include separate covers, binders,  clips, tabs, plastic inserts, maps, brochures, or any other items that cannot be processed easily  on a photocopy machine with an automatic feed. do not bind, clip, staple, or fasten in any way  separate sections of the application. applicants are advised that the copies of the application  submitted, not the original, will be reproduced by the federal government for review. all  application materials must be one-sided for duplication purposes. all pages in the  application submission must be sequentially numbered.    addresses for submission of paper applications  see section iv.7. other submission requirements for

be used during their planning activities to  revise their implementation plans and address anticipated implementation, logistical, and  administrative issues.  project timeline and milestones  provide quantitative monthly or quarterly projections of the accomplishments to be achieved for  each function, or activity, in such terms as the number of people to be served and the number of  activities accomplished. data may be organized and presented as project tasks and subtasks with  their corresponding timelines during the project period. for example, each project task could be  assigned to a row in the first column of a grid. then, a unit of time could be assigned to each  subsequent column, beginning with the first unit (i.e., week, month, quarter) of the project and  ending with the last.  shading, arrows, or other markings could be used across the applicable  grid boxes or cells, representing units of time, to indicate the approximate duration and/or  frequency of each task and its start and end dates within the project period.    when accomplishments cannot be quantified by activity or function, list them in chronological  order to show the schedule of accomplishments and their target dates.  program performance evaluation plan  applicants must describe the plan for the program performance evaluation that will contribute   25 of 54 to continuous quality improvement. the program performance evaluation should monitor  ongoing processes and the progress towards the goals and objectives of the project.  include  descriptions of the inputs (e.g., organizational

by the department of health  and human services (hhs) or another cognizant federal agency.    note: an applicant must enclose a copy of the current approved rate agreement.  if the applicant  is requesting a rate that is less than what is allowed under the program, the authorized  representative of the applicant organization must submit a signed acknowledgement that the  applicant is accepting a lower rate than allowed.    2) per 45 cfr  § 75.414(f) indirect (f&a) costs, “any non-federal entity [i.e., applicant]   31 of 54 that has never received a negotiated indirect costs rate, ... may elect to charge a de minimis  rate of 10%  of modified total direct costs (mtdc) which may be used indefinitely.   as  described in § 75.403, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs,  but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both.  if chosen, this  methodology once elected must be used consistently for all federal awards until such time  as a non-federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-federal entity may  apply to do at any time.”      justification:  this method only applies to applicants that have never received an approved  negotiated indirect cost rate from hhs or another cognizant federal agency.  applicants  awaiting approval of their indirect cost proposal may request the 10 percent de minimis rate.   when the applicant chooses this method, costs included in the indirect cost pool must not be  charged as direct costs to the grant.  commitment of non-federal resources  description: amounts of non-federal resources that will be used to support the project as  identified in block 18 of the sf-424.    for all federal awards, any shared costs or matching funds and all contributions, including  cash and third-party in-kind contributions, must be accepted as part of the recipient’s cost  sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the criteria listed in 45 cfr § 75.306.     for awards that require matching by statute, recipients will be held accountable for  projected commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget  justifications by budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards, even if the  projected commitment exceeds the amount required by the statutory match. a recipient’s  failure to provide the statutorily required matching amount may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.     for awards that do not require matching or cost sharing by statute, where “cost sharing”  refers to any situation in which the recipient voluntarily shares in the costs of a project other  than as statutorily required matching, recipients will be held accountable for projected  commitments of non-federal resources in their application budgets and budget justifications by  budget period, or by project period for fully funded awards . these include situations in which  contributions are voluntarily proposed by an applicant and are accepted by acf. non-federal  cost sharing will be included in the approved project budget so that the applicant will be held  accountable for proposed non-federal cost-sharing funds as shown in the notice of award  (noa). a recipient’s failure to provide voluntary cost sharing of non-federal resources  that have been accepted by acf as part of the approved project costs and that have been  shown as part of the approved project budget in the noa, may result in the disallowance  of federal funds. recipients will be required to report these funds in the federal financial  reports.     justification: if an applicant is relying on match from a third party, then a firm commitment of   32 of 54 these resources (letter(s) or other documentation) is required to be submitted with the  application. detailed budget information must be provided for every funding source identified  in item18. \"estimated funding ($)\" on the sf-424.     applicants are required to fully identify and document in their applications the specific costs or  contributions they propose in order to meet a matching requirement. applicants are also  required to provide documentation in their applications on the sources of funding or  contribution(s). in-kind contributions must be accompanied by a justification of how the stated  valuation was determined. matching or cost sharing must be documented by budget period (or  by project period for fully funded awards). a recipient’s failure to provide a statutorily  required matching amount may result in the disallowance of federal funds.    applications that lack the required supporting documentation will not be disqualified from  competitive review; however, it may impact an application’s scoring under the evaluation  criteria in section v.1. of this announcement.    paperwork reduction disclaimer  as required by the paperwork reduction act of 1995, 44 u.s.c. §§ 3501-3521, the public  reporting burden for the project description and budget/budget justification is estimated to  average 60 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and  maintaining the data needed, and reviewing the collection information. the project description  and budget/budget justification information collection is approved under omb control number  0970-0139, expiration date is 01/31/2019. an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person  is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid  omb control number.        application submission options   electronic submission via www.grants.gov   this section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for acf program  applications. please read the following instructions carefully and completely.    electronic delivery  acf is participating in the grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site  to find and apply for grant funding opportunities. acf applicants are required to submit their  applications online through grants.gov.    how to register and apply through grants.gov  read the following instructions about registering to apply for acf funds. applicants should read  the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the  registration process. reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the  registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information.    the registration process can take up to four weeks to complete. therefore, registration should be   33 of 54 done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact your ability to meet required application  submission deadlines.    organization applicants can find complete instructions here:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration.html    obtain a duns number: all entities applying for funding, including renewal funding, must  have a data universal numbering system (duns) number from dun & bradstreet (d&b).  applicants must enter the duns number in the data entry field labeled \"organizations  duns\" on the sf-424 form.    for more detailed instructions for obtaining a duns number, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration/step-1-obtain-duns- number.html    register with sam: in addition to having a duns number, organizations applying online  through grants.gov must register with the system for award management (sam). all  organizations must register with sam in order to apply online. failure to register with sam  will prevent your organization from applying through grants.gov.    for more detailed instructions for registering with sam, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration/step-2-register-with- sam.html    create a grants.gov account: the next step in the registration process is to create an  account with grants.gov. applicants must know their organization's duns number to  complete this process. completing this process automatically triggers an email request for  applicant roles to the organization's e-business point of contact (ebiz poc) for review. the  ebiz poc is a representative from your organization who is the contact listed for sam. to  apply for grants on behalf of your organization, you will need the aor role.    for more detailed instructions about creating a profile on grants.gov, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration.html    authorize grants.gov roles: after creating an account on grants.gov, the ebiz poc  receives an email notifying them of your registration and request for roles. the ebiz poc  will then log in to grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the  aor role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of  your organization. you will be able to submit your application online any time after you  have been approved as an aor.    for more detailed instructions about creating a profile on grants.gov. refer to:  https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize-roles.html    track role status: to track your role request, refer to:    34 of 54 https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track-role-status.html    when applications are submitted through grants.gov, the name of the organization's aor that  submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the  electronic signature. the ebiz poc must authorize individuals who are able to make legally  binding commitment on behalf of the organization as an aor; this step is often missed and it is  crucial for valid and timely submissions.    how to submit an application to acf via grants.gov  grants.gov applicants can apply online using workspace. workspace is a shared, online  environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different  webforms within an application. for each foa, you can create individual instances of a  workspace.    the following is an overview of applying via grants.gov. for access to complete instructions on  how to apply for opportunities, refer to: https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/apply-for- grants.html   create a workspace: creating a workspace allows you to complete an application online  and route it through your organization for review before submitting.    complete a workspace: add participants to the workspace, complete all the required forms,  and check for errors before submission.  adobe reader: if you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download  individual pdf forms in workspace so that they will appear similar to other standard or  acf forms. the individual pdf forms can be downloaded and saved to your local  device storage, network drive(s), or external drive(s), then accessed through adobe  reader.    note: visit the adobe software compatibility page on grants.gov to download the  appropriate version of the software at:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe-software-compatibility.html    mandatory fields in forms: in the forms, you will note fields marked with an asterisk  and a different background color. these fields are mandatory fields that must be  completed to successfully submit your application.    complete sf-424 fields first: the forms are designed to fill in common required  fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and duns number. to  trigger this feature, an applicant must complete the sf-424 information first. once it is  completed, the information will transfer to the other forms.  submit a workspace: an application may be submitted through workspace by clicking the  sign and submit button on the manage workspace page, under the forms tab. grants.gov  recommends submitting your application at least 24-48 hours prior to the close date to  provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the   35 of 54 application submission.    track a workspace: after successfully submitting a workspace package, a grants.gov  tracking number (grantxxxxxxxx) is automatically assigned to the package. the  number will be listed on the confirmation page that is generated after submission.  for additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to:   https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/applicant-training.html    grants.gov provides applicants 24/7 support via the toll-free number 1-800-518-4726 and email  at support@grants.gov. for questions related to the specific grant opportunity, contact the number  listed in the application package of the grant you are applying for.    if you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the grants.gov support  center and get a ticket number. the support center ticket number will assist acf with tracking  your issue and understanding background information on the issue.    timely receipt requirements and proof of timely submission  all applications must be received by 11:59 p.m., et, on the due date established for each  program. proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by grants.gov. an electronic  date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by  grants.gov. the applicant aor will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking  number (grantxxxxxxxx) from grants.gov with the successful transmission of their  application. applicant aors will also receive the official date/stamp and grants.gov tracking  number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission.    when acf successfully retrieves the application from grants.gov, and acknowledges the  download of submission, grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the  application to the email address of the applicant with the aor role. again, proof of timely  submission shall be the official date and time that grants.gov receives your application.  applications received by grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be  considered late and will not be considered for funding by acf.    applicants with slow internet, such as dial-up connections, should be aware that transmission can  take some time before grants.gov receives your application. again, grants.gov will provide  either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant  with the aor role. the grants.gov support center reports that some applicants end the  transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. please  be patient and give the system time to process the application.    issues with federal systems  for any systems issues experienced with grants.gov or sam.gov, please refer to acf’s “policy  for applicants experiencing federal systems issues” document for complete guidance  at

at sam  (www.sam.gov). see section iv.3. unique entity identifier and system for award management  (sam).    initial acf screening  each application will be screened to determine whether it meets any of the disqualification  factors described in section iii.3.other, application disqualification factors.    disqualified applications are considered to be “non-responsive” and are excluded from the  competitive review process. applicants will be notified of a disqualification determination by  email or by usps postal mail within 30 federal business days from the closing date of this  foa.    objective review and results  applications competing for financial assistance will be reviewed and evaluated by objective  review panels using only the criteria described in section v.1. criteria of this announcement.  each panel is composed of experts with knowledge and experience in the area under review.  generally, review panels include three reviewers and one chairperson.    results of the competitive objective review are taken into consideration by acf in the selection  of projects for funding; however, objective review scores and rankings are not binding. scores  and rankings are only one element used in the award decision-making process.     acf may elect not to fund applicants with management or financial problems that would  indicate an inability to successfully complete the proposed project. applications may be funded   45 of 54 in whole or in part. successful applicants may be funded at an amount lower than that  requested. acf reserves the right to consider preferences to fund organizations serving  emerging, unserved, or under-served populations, including those populations located in  pockets of poverty. acf will also consider the geographic distribution of federal funds in its  award decisions.  acf may refuse funding for projects with what it regards as unreasonably high start-up costs  for facilities or equipment, or for projects with unreasonably

    "andrei lapenas": "project summary. the large, forested landscapes of the northeastern usa and canada comprise a set of linked key resources: an important economic asset for forest industry, key carbon sequestration mechanism, and principal natural habitat for flora, fauna and humans in a region generally substantially affected by humans (especially on the us side). these forested landscapes are characterized by many ecological interdependencies; understanding the critical rules of life with regard to these interdependencies is important from several perspectives. among many potential challenges in this climate-sensitive ecosystem, there are two primary existential threats directly affecting the rules of life and, consequently, forest ecosystem functions and sustainability under changing environmental conditions.  the first threat is global warming and its impact on climate- sensitive tree species. most projections of climate-driven change in forest composition are based on modeling, and assumptions of climate tolerance are based largely on equilibrium, pre-warming geographic ranges. here we propose to study transient responses to warming of two tree species expected to be among the most sensitive to heat stress in the northeastern north america: red spruce (picea rubens) and white spruce (picea glauca). by improving our understanding of species biology (e.g., growth, phenology) near their climatic range limits we will improve our understanding of how they adapt to heat stress and interact with atmospheric pollution and soil acidification, and we will be able to better assess the fate of these long-lived species at the time of rapid environmental change.    the second threat is the eastern spruce budworm (choristoneura fumiferana) (esb) - a native periodic major threat currently in an outbreak in northern canada and likely imminent within the next few years in northern usa given the history of the past outbreaks. esb larvae emerge once a critical average ambient temperature of 10ºc is achieved; thus the relationships between average warming thresholds with increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations (and consequent moves forward of these historic thresholds in the spring) versus phenological changes in tree growing season and budburst will be critical in the scale of effects (e.g. global warming leading to more severe and longer outbreaks, and also to potential shifts in target species and thus entirely new sets of interrelations). in this project, interdisciplinary team of scientists will estimate contemporary and historic sensitivity of red and white spruce to warming and to esb outbreaks by employing three independent methods. first, they will conduct study of growth response of individual trees to interannual variations in weather conditions, along transect from central ny (us) to northeastern quebec (canada). second, the team will conduct extensive tree-core sampling along the same transect to test white and red spruce historic sensitivity to interannual climate variability and esb outbreaks. finally, the team will merge two forest inventory networks in the us and canada to evaluate tree growth and forest change in climate-sensitive red and white spruce dominated forests of the northeastern north america.  this work will broadly impact student training and public outreach. team members will incorporate study results into their courses at ualbany, suny esf, and cornell university. the first site in this transect, huyck preserve (ny), hosts approximately 900 students each year for grade school field trips and summer education programs. this project will provide the children with an opportunity for field trips and instrumentation demonstrations. team members will give several summer public education program lectures. additional educational outreach is possible through approximately 4,700 people that follow huyck preserve lectures on social media. another \"hot spot\" of training and outreach activity will be suny esf cranberry lake biological station (ny) where 200-300 undergraduate students participate in various courses in field biology and ecology each summer. this research project would provide an opportunity for the students to learn about monitoring tree phenology and how these cold-temperate and climate-sensitive ecosystems respond to climate warming. suny esf also operates the adirondack interpretive center, an important gateway to the adirondack park where annually thousands of hikers, campers, and other tourists interested in the climate sensitive 'northern forests' have an opportunity to learn about this ecosystem from professional naturalists and suny esf student interns; this venue would expand public outreach opportunities of our project. finally, the project would facilitate regular interactions among us and canadian students working together to preserve their common natural heritage of northeastern forests.       overview: an interdisciplinary team of us and canadian scientists will investigate potential limits of  phenotypic plasticity and response of red spruce (picea rubens) and white spruce (picea glauca) to  warming and to outbreaks of eastern spruce budworm (choristoneura fumiferana) esb by employing  three independent methods. first, they will study current growth responses of individual mature trees to  interannual variations in climatic conditions along an 867-km transect from central ny (us) to southern  quebec (canada). second, the team will conduct extensive tree-core sampling and analyses (~280+  trees, 1800 paired stable isotope, o, c analyses and 220  14 c measurements) along the same transect to  test white and red spruce historic sensitivity to interannual climate variability, esb outbreaks and spatial  variability in soil properties. finally, the team will merge results obtained along proposed transect into  analysis of two forest inventory networks in the us and canada (> 20,000 forested plots), and build  mathematical models suitable for disentangling multiple, related to climate change simultaneous drivers  of tree growth, and scaling up observed responses from trees and plots level to the scale of red and white  spruce dominated forests of northeastern north america (na).  intellectual merit: among many potential challenges in northeastern na climate-sensitive ecosystems,  two primary existential threats might have antagonistic effect on forest ecosystem functions and  sustainability. the first threat is global warming and its impact on climate-sensitive tree species. most  projections of climate-driven change in forest composition are based on modeling and assumptions of  climate tolerance that are based largely on pre-warming geographic ranges. here we propose to study  transient responses to warming of two tree species expected to be among the most sensitive to heat  stress in northeastern na: red spruce (picea rubens) and white spruce (picea glauca). by improving our  understanding of species  growth and phenology response to temperature increase near their climatic  range limits, we will improve our understanding of how spruce species adapt to heat stress and interact  with pests, atmospheric pollution and soil acidification. this information will provide valuable insight into  the fate of these ecologically and economically important long-lived species at the time of rapid  environmental change. the second threat is the eastern spruce budworm (choristoneura fumiferana)  (esb)—a native periodic threat to forests currently in outbreak in northern canada and likely to move into  southern canada and the northeastern usa within the next few years given the history of past outbreaks.  esb larvae emerge once a daily average ambient temperature of 10ºc is achieved; thus, the  relationships between warming thresholds under increasing atmospheric co 2  concentrations and  phenological changes in growing season events such as budburst will be critical to the scale of effects.  warming may lead to more severe and longer outbreaks and to potential shifts in tree species and thus  new sets of interrelations.    broader impact: this work contributes to both: theoretical knowledge about mechanism of tree  responses to climate warming as well as practical implications of the impact of warming on northern  forests. this is especially vital now at a time when forest managers are looking for potential climate  change-adaptation strategies. previous research addressed acclimation limits of spruce seedlings and  saplings to warmer temperatures under various moisture regimes. here pis increase ecological realism of  studies by addressing acclimation potential at the level of stands and populations of mature spruce trees  to temperatures exceeding photosynthetic optimum. furthermore, these data will reflect on the case  where forest ecosystems are subjected to various levels of esb infestations. because of unique setting of  our transect and forest plot data across a gradient in atmospheric acidic deposition, our results will be  helpful for understanding how recovery of acidified soils might interfere with acclimation and carbon  sequestration potential of spruce-pest system of northeastern forests. team members will incorporate  study results into their courses at ualbany, suny esf, and cornell university. the first site in this  transect, huyck preserve (ny), hosts approximately 900 students each year for grade-school field trips  and summer education programs. this project will provide the children with an opportunity for field trips  and instrumentation demonstrations. team members will give several summer public education program  lectures. additional educational outreach is possible with approximately 4,700 people following huyck  preserve lectures on social media. another location of training and outreach activity will be the suny  esf cranberry lake biological station (ny) where 200-300 undergraduate students participate in various  courses in field biology and ecology each summer. our research project would provide an opportunity for  the students to learn about monitoring tree phenology and how these cold-temperate and climate- sensitive tree species respond to climate warming (including potential honors thesis projects). suny esf  also operates the adirondack interpretive center, which offers programs on the adirondack ecosystem to  thousands of hikers, campers, and other tourists each year. those interested in this unique ecosystem  have an opportunity to learn from professional naturalists and suny esf student interns.

    "alex greer": "  project summary overview: this proposal requests funds to investigate the role of place attachment in residential adjustment after  wildfires, in california and nationwide. after wildfires, affected households face a decision point: do they  rebuild in the same way, rebuild with new mitigation efforts, or relocate? few studies have examined the  factors that influence these residential decision-making processes, particularly the role of intangible  factors like place attachment. increasing our understanding of the nature and role of place attachment in  post-disaster adjustment is integral to sustainable, efficacious, resident-centric recovery. this exploratory  sequential mixed methods study will systematically examine place attachment in the understudied yet  broadly applicable context of wildfires to improve understanding of place attachment in residential  decision-making after disasters. this study begins with an investigation of residential adjustment among  homeowners affected by california wildfires using photovoice. findings from the california communities  will inform the development of a nationwide survey of homeowners who have been affected by wildfire  to examine the role of place attachment in residential adjustment decisions and to test and validate place  attachment scales that are appropriate in disaster contexts. building on a modified ecological model, the  following research questions guide this inquiry: rq1: what place-based factors influence residents’  interpretation of the post-disaster environment? rq2: what role does place attachment play in post- disaster residential adjustment, including rebuilding, mitigation, and relocation? rq3: to what extent do  current place attachment measures capture the observed dynamics of place attachment in disaster  contexts?    intellectual merit: the present study will produce transformative results in five ways. first, the multidisciplinary research  team is uniquely equipped to capture the role of place attachment in post-disaster residential adjustment,  test the model’s applicability in a post-disaster context, and iterate upon it to build place attachment  measures applicable in disaster settings. second, while social capital has received much scholarly  attention in disaster studies, place attachment remains sorely under-researched. the phenomenological  approach adopted here will expose new links between place attachment and social capital, with  implications for disaster theory. third, the study’s focus on the cultural element of place attachment  answers a wider call for developing community informed, culturally appropriate, and inclusive  approaches to hazard risk reduction championed by fema’s national disaster recovery framework and  other guiding documents in the field. fourth, this proposal is methodologically novel. the use of  photovoice is rare in disaster sciences, though this method can improve engagement with isolated and  marginalized populations. this study will establish research best practices for the future use of  photovoice, and further advance the field methodologically by integrating photovoice with a nationwide  survey, qualitative comparative analysis, and scale development. finally, since study sites include fires  that were started by publicly acknowledged institutional failures, this study will explore the role of  disaster etiology in shaping place attachments.    broader impacts: this study investigates post-fire residential adjustment among affected communities by offering a  contextualized, in-depth examination of the relationship between place attachment, relocation, and  mitigation. this approach will identify avenues for improving community recovery and adaptation for a  diverse set of communities and leverage residents’ local knowledge to inform recovery decision making.  the study will produce narrative and photographic data illustrating community characteristics that  residents consider vital, providing new insight into cultural aspects of mitigation and recovery and  enhancing education and outreach programs that encourage sustained wildfire mitigation. a deeper  understanding of when and how place attachment promotes—or hinders—mitigation and recovery will  yield valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers working to promote ‘fire adapted communities’,  one of the central goals of federal wildfire policy. case study locations are representative not only of  california, but of other wildfire-prone areas as well, as they vary according to wildfire histories, scale of  recent events, mitigation policies, and socioeconomic diversity. lastly, study findings will be transferable  to other hazards, including locations where policymakers are strategically influencing residential decision  making with buyout programs and locations imminently facing loss of hazard insurance coverage.

    "arunrichard chandrasekaran": "project summary/abstract  alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive capacity. currently available treatments for ad are symptomatic agents that aim to improve cognitive and behavioral symptoms without altering the underlying course of the disease or slowing disease progression. thus, there is a necessity for disease-modifying treatment strategies for ad that can block or modify the molecular pathological steps leading to neurodegeneration. rna interference is one such strategy that has been actively pursued for selective knockdown of ad target genes, but typically used viral vectors have preparation and safety concerns.  we propose a new dna nanotechnology approach to overcome these issues. dna nanotechnology offers near-atomic control over building shapes and structures, eliminating heterogeneity in size of drug carriers. dna can be functionalized with additional chemical groups that allow controllable attachment of drug molecules and protect the drug against biological degradation. since dna is a biological material, dna nanostructures elicit minimal immune response when used in drug delivery, are non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable. further, dna nanostructures can enter cells without the need for a transfection agent. our approach will use dna polyhedra as model structures for rna interference based treatment of ad. specifically, we will: (1) develop dna polyhedra with controllable attachment of small interfering rnas (sirnas) and incorporate 2'-o-methyl strands to enhance biostability in physiological environments, and (2) establish viability of dna nanostructure-based drug delivery in human induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc) derived ad model cell lines.  our proposal brings together an interdisciplinary team comprising a diverse group of researchers in chemistry, biology, and neurological disorders to provide a novel approach for rnai treatment of ad. the proposed strategy has a number of advantages including (i) precise drug loading and quantification, (i) biocompatibility and biodegradability, (iii) low dosage with high efficacy, and (iv) enhanced biostability to withstand physiological conditions and complex biofluids. we anticipate that our approach will provide a robust proof of concept for viable sirna delivery by dna nanostructures with great future potential for clinical treatment of ad.   x-ray crystallography is the most prominent method for structure determination of macromolecules, but is restricted by the inability to form adequate crystals of some biomolecules. in cases where crystal growth is possible, large single crystals are required for x-ray data collection at synchrotron facilities. to address this macromolecular crystallization problem, 3d lattices built using dna could act as scaffolds for hosting hard-to-crystallize biomolecules. rationally designed dna motifs have been assembled into 3d dna crystals with different cavity sizes that can host guest molecules such as triplex forming oligonucleotides, optical dyes and an octaniline molecule. however, their crystal resolution is still limited to ~4-7 å. this low resolution limits the potential use of such 3d dna crystals as scaffolds for structure determination through x-ray crystallography.   the recently developed method of serial femtosecond x-ray crystallography (sfx) allows x-ray diffraction data collection using \"small\" crystals (nanometer to micrometer dimensions). in sfx, single-crystal x-ray diffraction 'snapshots' are collected from a stream of microcrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-x-ray free-electron laser (xfel). structural imaging using sfx prevents radiation damage of crystals, eliminates the need for large crystals that are likely to have significant defect structures and eliminates the need for freezing, which is likely to have an impact on large crystals by poor vitrification of the solvent.   in this work, we will design and create 3d crystalline lattices self-assembled from dna motifs for analysis using sfx to prevent resolution impediments that are part of routine x-ray diffraction methods. specifically, we will (1) develop methods to grow microcrystals of designed dna motifs, (2) characterize microcrystal formation and crystal concentration and (3) analyze crystal stability and quality for snapshot data collection. examining crystals in very small lattices without freezing will answer a number of questions about the determinants of crystal quality. once we have learned how to maximize the resolution of crystals with adequate cavity sizes, we will begin to introduce guest molecules into the cavities to use the rationally designed 3d dna lattices as structural scaffolds. improving the ability to determine the structure of hard-to-crystallize biomolecules will be highly useful in developing better ligands and drugs for biological and disease processes.    summary  alzheimer's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive abnormalities. with no cure and minimal early detection, there are serious research efforts into all aspects of the disease spanning from basic disease biology to clinical diagnosis and treatment. molecular diagnosis methods for ad typically rely on highly invasive cerebrospinal fluid collection and detection of tau protein and amyloid-beta (aβ) biomarkers. however, these biomarkers alone may not reflect the complex molecular pathophysiology of ad. thus, there is a need for studying changes in other biomarkers using minimally-invasive methods.   micrornas have recently been studied for their roles in several biological processes related to progression of ad. the differential levels of micrornas in circulating fluids such as blood, serum, plasma and exosomes could be used as potential biomarkers for early detection of ad. while methods exist for conventional microrna detection such as rt-qpcr, microarrays, next generation sequencing and northern blotting, some of these methods need multiple steps, expensive equipment and time-consuming strategies for readout. thus a microrna detection method with a simple workflow that allows screening and quantification of micrornas is required for ad research.  working towards this goal, here we will develop a microrna detection assay based on molybdenum disulfide (mos2) nanosheets coupled with fluorescent dna beacons. layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides such as mos2 are recently of growing interest due to their unique physical, chemical and electronic properties. in this proposal, we will combine the advantages of mos2 nanosheets with dna beacons that can respond to specific microrna sequences. we will use the sensor to screen and quantify dysregulation of ad-associated micrornas in healthy and ad brain total rna. our method could serve as a diagnostic tool to obtain non-invasive detection of ad biomarkers and other neurological diseases. our approach can be applied in research setting as an alternative to qpcr and northern blotting towards screening of micrornas for biomarker discovery. ultimately, our approach also has potential to identify and measure circulating or exosomal micrornas as ad biomarkers for early detection as well as monitoring at-risk patients.      project abstract/summary  drug delivery systems with controllable drug loading and efficient cell entry could be transformative for treatment  of a number of diseases. controlled drug delivery increases overall bioavailability while reducing the required  drug  dosage,  thereby  reducing  the  severe  side  effects  often associated with small  molecule  treatment. while  organic  and  inorganic  drug  delivery  systems  lack  size  homogeneity  and  quantifiable  drug  attachment,  the  emerging   field   of   dna   nanotechnology   provides   a   solution   that   offers controllable   size   and   inherent    biocompatibility.     we propose to utilize dna nanotechnology to create size-specific non-toxic nanostructure delivery systems that  allow  pre-defined,  controllable release of  small  molecule  drugs,  targeted  delivery,  and  protection against  biological   degradation by   specific   chemical   modifications.   since   dna   is   a   biological   material,   dna    nanostructures  elicit  minimal  immune  response  when  used  in  drug  delivery,  are  non-toxic,  biocompatible  and   biodegradable. our approach will use dna tetrahedra and icosahedra as model delivery platform to encapsulate  and  deliver  novel  small  molecule  compounds  that  target  the  disease  mechanism  of  the  multi-systemic  neuromuscular disorder myotonic dystrophy 1 (dm1).  this disease is a member of a large family of 40+ repeat  expansion diseases that share a molecular disease mechanism and currently lack effective treatment options.  specifically,  we  will:  1)  develop  dna  polyhedra  for  loading  novel small  molecule  ligands;  2) assess  cell-  and  disease-specific targeting of dna nanostructure-based drug delivery; and 3) demonstrate proof-of-concept drug  delivery and efficacy in    dm1 mouse models.    our proposal brings together a diverse group of researchers in chemistry, nanotechnology and biology to provide  a  novel  approach  for  the  development  and  optimization  of  controllable  drug  delivery  vehicles  for  biomedical   research and therapeutic development. the proposed strategy has a number of advantages including (i) precise  drug  loading  and  quantification,  (ii)  biocompatibility  and  biodegradability,  (iii)  cell  entry  without  transfection   agents, and (iv) enhanced biostability to withstand physiological conditions and complex biofluids. we anticipate  that our approach will provide a robust proof of concept for viable drug delivery by dna nanostructures for the  leading cause of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, dm1, with great future therapeutic potential across the entire  family of 40+ neurodegenerative repeat expansion diseases.

    "li niu": "  project summary  the goal of this research is to make a class of rna aptamers that act as ampa receptor inhibitors, and  test the efficacy and safety of these aptamers in a mouse model. these rna aptamers could become a  new, potential   drug   candidate   for   treatment   of   amyotrophic   lateral   sclerosis   (als). als is   a  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterized  by  the  progressive  loss  of  motor  neurons  in  the  brain,  brainstem and spinal cord. currently none of als drugs effectively alters the disease course. developing  better inhibitors to control the excessive ampa receptor activity is a promising strategy for the discovery  of new and more effective als drugs. this is because ca 2+  influx through abnormally expressed, ca 2+ - permeable ampa receptors in motor neurons leads to selective cell death. riluzole, one of the two fda- approved als drugs, actually has anti-glutamatergic properties. using an in vitro evolution approach, we  have identified a group of 14 potent rna aptamers targeting ampa receptors. these aptamers are more  potent, highly selective  and  water  soluble, as  compared  with  conventional  small-molecule  inhibitors.  these properties should enable us to use aptamers at the lowest dose possible to achieve therapeutic  efficacy by more tightly and selectively blocking ampa receptor activities in vivo with minimal or even no  dose-dependent side  effects. the  hypothesis  to  be  tested  is  that  a  combination  of  using  aptamers  as  better ampa receptor antagonists and testing them in the ar2 mouse model will allow us to assess the  therapeutic  efficacy  and  safety  of  our  aptamers. the ar2 mouse  is  a  unique  animal  model  where an  abnormally ca 2+ -permeable ampa receptor subunit is expressed in motor neurons, causing eventual cell  death. thus, the ar2 mouse model is ideal to test our ampa receptor aptamers in blocking abnormal  ampa  receptor activity. in  aim  1,  we  propose  to make a  large  quantity for  each  of  the 14 chemically  modified aptamers. these aptamers will be pure, stable and biologically functional assayed by whole-cell  recording. in aim 2, we will test each of these 14 aptamers, both individually and in combination, in first  in ar2 mice. aptamers will be administrated through intracerebroventricular injection to bypass the blood- brain   barrier. aptamer-treated   and -untreated mice   will   be   compared   for changes   in   tdp-43  immunohistochemistry, behaviors, loss of motor neurons and body weight, and survival rate to assess  the efficacy and the safety of the aptamers. the outcome of this research is to identify a set of aptamers  that are efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. if successful, this research should lay ground work for clinical  testing of some of these aptamers as a potential new als therapy.      lay abstract    amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in the death  of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. excitotoxicity is a leading pathogenic mechanism for the  selective death of motor neurons in als. because excitotoxicity is mainly mediated by ca 2+  influx to  motor  neurons  via  abnormally  expressed,  ca 2+ -permeable ampa receptors,  developing  inhibitors  to  block excessive ampa receptor activity is a promising als drug discovery strategy. in fact, riluzole  and edaravone,  the  two  als  drugs,  both  act  to  reduce  glutamate-induced  excitotoxicity,  among  their  other activities. here we combine two novel approaches for developing a new class of ampa receptor  inhibitors or rna aptamers that are different from traditional small-molecule compounds. first, using  an in  vitro evolution  approach  called  selex,  we  have  previously  identified  a  group  of  potent  rna  inhibitors or aptamers selectively targeting ampa receptors. these rna aptamers are more potent and  selective  towards  ampa  receptors,  as  compared  with  existing  ampa  receptor  inhibitors. these  superior properties would enable us to use aptamers at the lowest dose possible to achieve therapeutic  efficacy by more tightly and selectively blocking ampa receptor activities in vivo, with minimal or no  side effects. next, we propose to test these aptamers in an als mouse model. we choose a transgenic  mouse model known as sod1 g93a mice. transgenic mice overexpressing human cu/zn superoxide  dismutase type-1 or sod1 with a glycine to alanine mutation in position 93 (sod1 g93a mice) is a  well-established  rodent  model  since  these  mice  develop  a  phenotype  similar  to  als  in  humans.  the  sod1 g93a mouse model is the most widely used one for als research and drug development. earlier  studies have suggested a glutamate-induced toxicity has a contributing role in the neurodegeneration in  the sod1 model, since glutamate receptor blockade shows some neuroprotection. for example, riluzole  has  been  shown  effective  in  this  mouse  model. this  proposal has  two  major  objectives:  (a)  making  highly  potent,  selective,  water-soluble  rna-based  aptamers  that  inhibit  ampa  receptors,  and  (b)  testing these aptamers for their safety and efficacy in rescuing the als phenotype in sod1 g93a mouse  model. we propose  to  conduct  a  series  of  tests  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of a  group  of aptamers. this  series of tests include (i) behavioral assays, such  as grip strength assay and rotarod assay to measure  motor activity, body weight, (ii) tissue assays, such as the count of the number of motor neurons and the  size of these motor neurons, and (iii) survival study. vehicle-treated and riluzole-treated mice will be  our  controls. because  our  rna  aptamers  have  supposedly  better  molecular  properties  than  those  traditional  small-molecule  antagonists  of  ampa receptors,  we  anticipate  that the dose  of  an  aptamer  could be administered as low as possible so that the therapeutic efficacy can be achieved with minimal  or no side effects. we hope to identify a set of aptamers that are efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. if  so, this research will lay important ground work for clinical testing of several most efficacious, safe and  long-lasting rna aptamers as a new als therapy for als patients.

    "charalampos chelmis": "  b.  project summary overview.the web of data, i.e., semantically enriched linked datasets, is rapidly expanding at the same time that knowledge graphs, one of the most well-known outcomes from the semantic web (sw) commu- nity, are driving novel technologies such as virtual assistants.  so why haven’t sw been a big buzz word like ai and big data?  while sw promises huge potentials by providing the backbone to modern informa- tion systems that require access to structured knowledge, it’s not exactly the easiest field to get into.  to query semantic data, users need to be intimately familiar with sw technologies, standards, and protocols, such as resource description framework (rdf), a graph-based representation format for semantic data, and sparql, the w3c-standardized query language for retrieving, and discovering relationships from data stored in rdf format. to date, a wide range of systems have been developed to benefit end-users from the expressive power of sparql while at the same time keeping them insulated from the complexities asso- ciated with editing and issuing sparql queries.  beyond querying semantic data however, the process of performing analytics over semantic datasets has remained obscure, slow and fragmented; end-users must perform a sequence of query-analyze-store tasks using a variety of repositories and tools. the goal of this career project is to resolve the computational barriers to the process of perform- ing analytics over semantic datasets, and to make semantic-centric data science practical and accessible for real-world applications.  to achieve this goal, research activities are proposed that comprise a big step to- wards extending the capability of semantic web technologies based on ideas from data mining and database systems. intellectual merit.to realize the vision of popularizing semantic-centric data science, three research thrusts are being proposed. first, a new graph abstraction for rdf* data will be devised, which in turn is expected to reduce storage requirements and enable novel analytics to be performed efficiently over web-scale se- mantic data.   second,  probabilistic querying  and inferencing  primitives will  be incorporate  directly into sparql. third, an iterative programming abstraction will be developed to ensure that the semantic-centric data science tasks can be executed over the proposed graph abstraction at scale on query time. broader impact.semantic repositories appear in a wide spectrum of domains including but not limited to bioinformatics, neuroscience, health care, and social sciences.  reducing the engineering effort and exper- tise required by non–statisticians to perform semantic–centric data science tasks on such datasets as directly as sql databases facilitate querying the data itself, has the potential to transform the very foundation of data-driven research discovery. if successful, the proposed approach, can be revolutionary in simplifying the discovery of patterns in a variety of application domains. finally, the project can significantly promote cise research capacity-building by (i) recruiting and retaining minorities and underrepresented groups (ualbany is a minority-serving institution with a large population of black and hispanic americans), (ii) engaging underserved populations in cutting-edge research activities to give them a better chance to develop inter- disciplinary attitudes and skills, and (iii) exposing students to interdisciplinary applications of statistics and semantic web. 1",
    "cecilia levy": "  project summary overview the goal of this work is to build on a prototype technology developed at ualbany and turn it into a novel type of dark matter (dm) detector that utilizes supercooled water as target material, and has very low energy threshold, making it particularly well suited for low mass dm searches. we propose to use supercooled water as an “inverse” bubble chamber (dubbed a snowball chamber), where an interacting particle deposits su\u0000cient energy within a critical radius to trigger a phase transition from liquid to solid. water is particularly advantageous as a material since it contains hydrogen and thus kinematically favors low mass recoils, while its oxygen content o↵ers an intrinsic multiple-element signature for discovery scenarios, both in the spin independent and dependent sectors. the proposed work is based on encouraging preliminary studies that showed at⇠5\u0000that neutrons create a phase transition from liquid to ice, and will tackle background rate, low deadtime, and low energy threshold, with the goal to have a full design ready, at the end of five years, to actually build and deploy a competitive small scale dm experiment. intellectual merit the discovery and identification of dm is a crucial area of research, and particularly the lowest- mass regions need to be investigated more, possible with new detectors like the snowball chamber. this work will provide the ability to search huge, unprobed regions of phase space for dm, with a projected sensitivity for spin-dependent proton coupling at 500 mev ofo(10 \u000040 )cm 2 , which probes a region no other experiment claims to access, o↵ering the only current possibility to detect dm that is light and p-spin-coupled. sensitivity for si wimp coupling is projected to beo(10 \u000043 )cm 2 . the level of scientific innovation exhibited for the proposed research is extraordinarily high, with the continued development of new technology that, with the exception of being based on the phase transition of a metastable fluid, is not a simple extrapolation of existing work.  the likelihood of achieving valuable results is equally high, as demonstrated by the working proof-of-concept prototype, and by the experience and appropriate skill set of the pi. broader impacts in line with the pi’s previous engagement and dedication to improving diversity in physics, the work proposed here comes with an extensive broader impact campaign that will target several generations of physicists: from small children to current graduate students. a museum exhibit with a small scale snowball chamber will be developed by undergraduate students. the exhibit will be an ideal educational tool, teaching children about several aspect of physics: the di↵erent states of matter, pressure and temperature, phase transitions, and radiation. the exhibit will be made very interactive, showing children cause and e↵ect, and the associated explanatory panels will be made very eye-catching, and pictorially understandable to even children who cannot read. in addition, a new edition of the very successful nsf-funded dmss: a dark matter summer school, is planned, as well as the organization of a conference for undergraduate women in physics. finally, at the departmental level, a series of colloquia within the context of the pi-founded society of women in physics at ualbany will be developed. to achieve these ambitious goals, the pi will enlist the help of her research group, thus already engaging the younger generation in outreach and diversity.",
    "kyoung-yeol kim": "project summary overview: the pi's long-term career goal is to improve our knowledge of resource recovery from used water (previously wastewater) thereby enable utilizing used water as new resources in the near future. a membrane electrode, an electrode that is chemically combined with a hydrophobic membrane, is a novel concept to enhance the mass transfer of products that are converted or captured by electrochemical reactions on the electrode. those products can be readily harvested in the recovery chamber via a hydrophobic membrane layer. however, the use of membrane electrodes for resource recovery is still preliminary. the research goal for this career proposal is to improve our knowledge on the recovery of two different resources in the used water (nh3 and volatile fatty acids, vfas) via functionalized activated carbon (ac) membrane electrodes, to ultimately achieve high recovery fluxes with high selectivity and low energy consumptions. functionalized ac membrane electrodes will be examined based on different mass transfer mechanisms: conversion and diffusion for nh3 and capacitive capturing for vfas. the research goal will be achieved via four objectives: 1) characterize catalyst binding sites and improve catalytic reactions to reduce electrode potential losses, 2) improve nh3 selectivity by electrode and membrane modifications, 3) understand vfas capacitive capturing and transfer mechanisms, and 4) analyze electrode fouling with actual used water and mitigate fouling.  the educational goal of the pi is to foster the next generation to perceive used water (not wastewater) as new resources and to lower educational barriers for k-12 students, especially from an underrepresented group. the pi will seamlessly integrate the project outcomes into educational activities, project outcomes will be used as proof of new directions for the used water handling. the educational goal will be achieved by the following activities: a) inviting high school students for a one-day long lab tour and workshop to provide opportunities for \"hands-on electrochemical resource recovery\" and visiting k-12 schools in the capital region ny for guest lectures, b) development of new course materials to teach a new sustainable used water treatment based on resource recovery in the classroom, and c) sharing lab displays and experimental methods with the public as well as other researchers online through the pi's youtube channel.   intellectual merit: the project will yield new knowledge on two mass transfer mechanisms via functionalized ac membrane electrodes: conversion and diffusion for nh3, and capacitive capturing for vfas. new knowledge on catalyst binding sites on the ac surface and their catalytic activities will give us new insights to develop more efficient membrane electrodes with specific functions to harvest various resources from complex streams. understanding recovery mechanisms with novel electrode modification methods will leverage electrochemistry-based resource recovery processes to improve product selectivity with lower energy requirements. understanding electrode fouling behaviors with actual anaerobic centrate and new fouling mitigation strategies will be useful to enhance the practicality of electrochemical resource recovery processes. broader impacts: currently, 1-2% of world energy consumption is being consumed to synthesize nh3 using a conventional haber-bosch process. improvements in nh3 recovery from wastewater will be useful to mitigate n emissions to the environment and save energy and money to synthesize nh3 for fertilizer production. also, the simultaneous recovery of value-added vfas will make this electrochemical recovery process more economically feasible. outreach activities for k-12 schools will attract more k-12 students to environmental engineering, especially from the underrepresented group in the capital region ny. new course materials will provide new insights about sustainable used water treatment for under/graduate students in the classroom. beyond offline activities, youtube videos will be used to disseminate new knowledge and share experimental methods and displays with the public and other professionals throughout the world.     project summary  overview: volatile fatty acids (vfas) are useful platform chemicals that are necessary for various industries but vfas are currently produced from fossil fuels. during anaerobic digestion, vfas are produced as byproducts and usually existed in a high concentration in the centrate. however, there have been no decisive methods to recover vfas from waste streams with high selectivity and low energy consumption. here, we propose a new electrochemical method to recover vfas from waste streams using activated carbon (ac)-based electrodes with a hydrophobic membrane layer. a new capacitive capturing method can attract negatively charged carboxylates (r-coo-) to ac pores by electrostatic force then capture adsorbed vfas in the recovery chamber using an acid solution by transforming them into acid form (r-cooh). the proposed method is promising but underlying mechanisms and key parameters are not fully understood yet. therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to understand underlying mechanisms of a new capacitive capturing method for vfa recovery using activated carbon membrane electrodes. first, vfa capacitive adsorption behaviors and the role of acid solution will be examined to understand the underlying mechanisms (objective1). second, vfa recovery fluxes and energy consumptions will be examined with ac membrane electrodes with different physicochemical properties to see the impacts of physicochemical properties of ac membrane electrodes (objective 2). finally, potential faradaic reactions (i.e., vfa oxidation) during capacitive adsorption and vfa mixtures with various anions will be examined to understand potential adverse reactions on the electrode and competition between vfas and anions (objective 3).   intellectual merit: the project will yield new knowledge on vfa recovery mechanisms via ac membrane electrodes driven by capacitive adsorption and capturing in the recovery chamber. new knowledge on mechanisms will give us answers regarding potential chemical bonding between adsorbed vfas and ac surface and the specific role of ph in the electrode to transform the adsorbed vfas (carboxylates) into acid form. understanding the impacts of physicochemical properties of ac membrane electrodes will be useful to optimize and improve the vfa recovery fluxes and energy consumption. analyses on potential faradaic reactions and competition between multiple vfas with other anions will be useful to understand potential risks of this concept and propose new directions to overcome those weaknesses.     broader impacts: the economic value of vfas is estimated at $800-$2500 per ton with the total global market demand of 18,500 kilo metric tons. current anaerobic digesters can produce approximately 21 mt of vfas on a global scale. project outcomes will leverage a re-evaluation of underestimated vfas produced from waste streams by suggesting an energy-efficient recovery concept with high selectivity. resource recovery toward sustainable wastewater treatment is a new paradigm for wastewater treatment but the sustainable concept is not quite highlighted in major textbooks. the pi will integrate project outcomes into new course materials to provide new insights regarding sustainable treatment with resource recovery for under/graduate students in the classroom. beyond offline activities, youtube videos will be used to disseminate new knowledge and share experimental methods and displays with the public and other professionals throughout the world.

(it01 2021) page | 3       classroom training and/or distance learning training  provide  funds to  secure purchase  of service (pos) agreements (subcontracts) with  private computer training vendors to provide proprietary or highly technical courses.  cobol/legacy training  on behalf of otda  the  office of information  technology  services (oits)  continues  to  maintain  the  existing mainframe-based  legacy  systems  and  applications  that  were  programmed in cobol at various intervals over the past 30+ years.  these applications  include the welfare management system (wms), the benefits issuance control system  (bics), the child support management system (csms) and the related systems such as  client notices.  the act of fulfilling long-term contingency plans along with the changing role of current  staff and the resulting influx of new staff has resulted in a marginally increased need for  the majority of legacy related training courses that have been offered for many years. it  is anticipated that these training needs will not increase dramatically as a primary focus  of the agency and oits is on retaining current staffing levels.  however, the availability  of this training is essential, as it is increasingly difficult to hire new staff with the requisite  cobol/legacy background.  open server application programming and maintenance  there are two components to this training requirement:  1) oits supports multiple mission critical open server-based applications such as the  welfare  reporting and tracking system (wrts) to meet federal reporting  requirements. the  objective is to train state staff in the development of  microsoft.net applications and reduce the reliance on contractors.  2) oits has also adopted java based technology for modernization activities. this  can include both vendor specific as well as open source technologies. we are using  these  tools  to  support  the modernization  of  a  30+  year  old  wms  system  and  mitigate the risks associated with an aging workforce.  project management  oits  and otda eisp (employment and  income support programs) are  seeking  to  access  advanced  training  in  the  use  of  the  microsoft  project tool  and  area  of general  project  management.    skills  need  to  be  developed  to  apply  project  management  principles in both large projects and smaller sub-projects as part of more global project  planning and implementation activities.   (it01 2021) page | 4     business analysis  it is a generally accepted principle of project planning that effective applications can only  be developed through the use of both skilled programmers as well as business analysts  that  identify and document  system  requirements  based  upon  business  needs, develop  program specifications and design application schematics that accurately depict what is  required by program guidelines.  these guidelines may include federal, state and local  statutes, regulations and business practices. the contractor will be expected to procure  business  analysis  training  for  both oits and eisp program  area staff involved  in  modernization development efforts.  service oriented architecture  oits  is  instituting  standardized  service  architecture  by  adopting  a  service  oriented  architecture  (soa)  approach  to  interfaces  and  integrations.    soa  requires  specific  training  such  as  xml  and  xslt  so  that oits  staff  are  proficient  in  the  practices  associated with standardized service development.  the following chart is not an all-inclusive list of courses. other courses will be identified  based  on  project  needs. there  may  be  a  need  for  customization  of  courses  and/or  otda/oits dedicated  course  offerings  to  meet  the  training  goals  and  needs of  otda/oits.   otda training and staff development (tsd),  the training provider  and  oits will prioritize which of these courses can be afforded within existing direct expense  category.  training requests will be submitted based on emergent topics and applications that are  deemed essential to the improvement of otda/oits staff skills.   *based on the legacy mainframe environment, per prior research and courses previously  customized for otda, it is anticipated that the vendors identified may be the sole source  provider for the course identified.  technical assistance  provide on-site  post-training  application relevant technical assistance  as  requested  by  otda.  component 2  provide  training  for  office  of temporary  and  disability  assistance  (otda)  staff,  and  contracted staff that use or maintain critical otda systems.

    "hannah attard": "  project summary  overview:  the  occurrence  of  one  or  several  extreme  weather  events  (ewes)  during  a  single  season  contributes  disproportionately  to  meteorological  statistics  for  that  season.  this observation  suggests that the environments that lead to the development of ewes, and their variability, must  be  considered  to  understand  the  dynamical  and  thermodynamic  processes  that  operate  at  the  weather–climate intersection. extreme temperature, precipitation, and wind events during the cool  season (september–may) are frequently tied to the location of surface cyclones and anticyclones,  which are modulated on the synoptic scale by the state and evolution of the upper-tropospheric jet  stream. consequently, this study adopts a jet-centered framework to investigate the tropospheric  and stratospheric processes that are conducive to the development of cool season ewes over north  america. the proposed work will use ecmwf era-interim data during 1979–2018 to (1) define  and examine the characteristics of combined north pacific jet (npj) and north atlantic jet (naj)  regimes, (2) investigate the influence of zonally-varying stratospheric regimes on the development  of  combined  npj–naj  regimes,  and  (3)  identify  environmental  discriminators  that  favor  the  occurrence of ewes over non-extreme days during combined npj–naj regimes and anomalous  stratospheric  regimes. combined  npj–naj  regimes  will  be  defined  using  a  two-dimensional  phase diagram that objectively describes the state and evolution of each jet in the context of its  two leading modes of variability, whereas anomalous stratospheric regimes will be defined using  self-organizing maps (soms) that are trained on track maps of the stratospheric polar vortex (spv)  and aleutian high (ah). a suite of elliptical diagnostics will be employed as part of “top-down”  approach to examine the interwoven relationship between stratospheric variability, the structure  and evolution of the upper-tropospheric jets, and ewes.    intellectual merit:   the proposed work directly addresses the first research need in the most recent national climate  assessment to “improve [our] understanding of the climate system and its drivers” by determining  the preferred stratospheric and upper-tropospheric jet stream configurations that are conducive to  the  development  of cool  season  ewes. additionally,  while  the  tropospheric  processes  that  modulate the upper-level jets and their evolution have been studied extensively, the extent to which  the  upper-level  jets  are  modulated  by  stratospheric  variability is  less  clear.  the  proposed  work  bridges the traditionally separate perspectives on spv variability and upper-tropospheric jet stream  variability to identify joint configurations of the spv and the upper-tropospheric jet stream that  favor ewes on medium-range to subseasonal time scales. last, the proposed work is novel in that  it considers the geometric variability and evolution of the spv and ah prior to ewes as opposed  to adopting a zonal-mean perspective.    broader impacts:   the results of this work have the potential to inform operational forecasts of ewes on medium- range to subseasonal time scales. to enable this potential, the diagnostics employed as part of the  proposed  work  will  be  implemented  in  real  time via web  interfaces hosted by the  pis on  their  personal websites. the proposed work will provide unique opportunities for the project team to  offer introductory  research  experiences  to  high-school  students  at  nardin  academy,  an  all-girls  college-preparatory school in buffalo, ny. members of the project team will also participate in  outreach activities with underserved k–12 students along the colorado front range using a suite  of demonstrations that have been developed by the atmospheric and oceanic sciences department  at cu boulder. finally, the project will support the training of a ph.d. student at cu boulder and  the development of an inclusive research group that will receive mentorship from both pis.

collaborative project will train 24 u.s. students (15 undergraduates and 9 graduates) including underrepresented minorities, women and first-generation students under a ten-week summer program for three years to gain international research experience in emerging air quality issues in the megacity of dhaka, bangladesh. each year a cohort of 8 students participate in pre-departure virtual training (two weeks), visit bangladesh for seven weeks and one week (in-person) post-trip follow-up in the u.s. in each cohort, each student will work on an individual project to address one unifying research theme - harnessing low-cost techniques to improve air quality. the objectives are to 1) broaden the international research experience and global awareness of the u.s. students, 2) enhance their practical and cultural experiences, and 3) strengthen and leverage collaborations with international institutions.   the project involves partnerships with professors at the university at albany (drs. md. aynul bari), collaborating with stanford university (dr. stephen luby) and faculties in the bangladesh university of engineering and technology (dr. provat kumar saha) and the university of dhaka (dr. abdus salam). the u.s. pis will recruit and prepare u.s. participants through pre-departure training on low-cost sensor technologies, performance and air quality sensor data analysis, culture and language instruction, remote mentoring during summer visit and support post-trip follow-up activities. the foreign collaborators in bangladesh will supervise u.s. students for their individual research projects and provide opportunities to enhance their professional growth through collaborative research training, mentoring, networking and developing their competencies in intercultural communication, self-awareness, professional adaptability, leadership, and professionalism. intellectual merit: in recent years, bangladesh has emerged as the most polluted country and dhaka is the fastest growing and the most polluted megacity in the world. the unifying research theme for this project is to improve air quality in bangladesh using low-cost approaches. the development and implementation of low-cost techniques can transform the ability of cities to address air pollution challenges and raise awareness about air quality problems. the intellectual merit of this project lies in the integration of novel internet of things (iot)-derived sensor technology and satellite remote sensing coupled with modeling to improve understanding of air pollution problems and their potential solutions. by leveraging the unique research facilities, data and other u.s. and foreign resources, the ires students will investigate emerging air quality issues in bangladesh. research topics include (1) evaluating calibration and performance of low cost sensors for a polluted city, (2) coupling low cost air sensors and satellite data for mapping brick kiln pollution, (3) developing a low-cost approach for evaluating kiln level emissions, (4) high spatial resolution air pollution mapping in dhaka city using low-cost sensors, (5) understanding residential indoor air quality exposure in dhaka using multipollutant sensors, (6) monitoring exposure to air pollutants and greenhouse gases in public transportation in dhaka city using low cost sensors, (7) estimation and characterization of waste burning impact in dhaka using low cost sensors, and (8) evaluation of satellite-based models in estimating the surface pm2.5 over bangladesh. broader impacts: the pi will develop a diverse stem workforce of young scientists to contribute broadly to advancing the u.s. mission of promoting the progress of science and engineering. the experiences and lessons learned from a megacity's impact on air quality can be valuable for the ires students to study large u.s. urban centers. the pi will plan to disseminate project results to the scientific community and the u.s. stem students in a number of ways through participation in distinguished speaker series, science forum, professional society meetings, public outreach activities and peer-reviewed journal

and air toxics that affect exposure across local scales. with a population of more than 1.2 million, calgary is the largest urban area in the oil and natural gas rich province of alberta and the third largest municipality in canada. to date, no study has assessed spatiotemporal variability in sources of air pollutants in the calgary regional airshed zone. the overarching goal of the proposed study is to improve understanding of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in sources of air pollutants across the calgary region. the specific objectives are to: • identify source types and impacts of local source emissions based on data from the 125 cstem monitoring sites across the calgary region, and • characterize seasonal variation, intra-urban and urban-rural variability in source contributions  the key hypotheses are: ambient and near-field outdoor concentrations of air pollutants can 1) vary spatially and temporally and 2) have strong localized signals influenced by nearby sources. under the calgary spatial and temporal exposure modeling (cstem) study, the proposed project will provide spatiotemporal information about sources for calgary region and findings can support local air zone management strategies and air pollution health studies.       overview:  the pi's long-term career goal is to improve air quality and public health by establishing a community-driven indoor and outdoor air quality network platform with an aim to reduce air pollution exposure. the current covid-19 pandemic with home isolation and adopting work from home highlights the importance of understanding impact on indoor air quality. in the united states, community air quality observation networks are limited in characterizing the diverse group of air pollutants e.g., black carbon, volatile organic compounds (vocs) that affect exposure across neighborhoods. there is also growing awareness about exposure to emerging contaminants such as per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (pfas) and microplastics in the air among residential neighborhoods. to address this gap, the overarching research objective of this career project is to understand spatiotemporal variation, sources and human health risks of indoor and outdoor air pollutants and emerging contaminants in urban and rural communities in new york state (nys) capital region and hudson valley region. specific objectives are to: 1) determine heterogeneity in indoor and outdoor concentrations of air pollutants and emerging contaminants at neighborhood communities, 2) determine pollution hotspots and less-polluted areas across neighborhoods, 3) identify indoor-generated and near-field outdoor (i.e., backyard) sources, 4) determine contributions of indoor and outdoor voc sources to ozone (o3) and secondary organic aerosol (soa) formation, and 5) determine heterogeneity in health risks associated with indoor and outdoor exposure to air toxics and emerging contaminants.  key approaches include 1) leveraging low-cost techniques to measure concentrations of indoor and outdoor air pollutants e.g., black carbon, particulate matter and total vocs for consecutive 7 days in 4 to 6 homes/apartments of each neighborhood to collect data over a 2-year period from at least 200 homes at residential neighborhoods including environmental justice (ej) communities, 2) time-integrated sampling for pfas, pm2.5 composition, speciated vocs and microplastics at homes/apartments, 3) determining pollution hotspots through in-car exposure measurements driving along neighborhood streets and across communities, 4) identifying indoor-generated sources and applying dispersion-normalized positive matrix factorization (pmf) model for improved outdoor source estimates, 5) determining contributions of voc sources to o3 and soa formation, and 6) determining source-specific health risks to public health. the pi's long-term educational goals are to prepare students in becoming future engineers and scientists for tackling environmental challenges, increase public literacy, awareness and promote environmental stewardship to improve air quality and public health. intellectual merit:  the intellectual merit of this project lies in 1) leveraging novel internet of things (iot)-derived relatively low-cost multipollutant sensors to advance understanding of spatiotemporal resolution of indoor and outdoor air pollutants, 2) harnessing inexpensive measurement technique to enhanced understanding of heterogeneity in indoor and outdoor air toxics and some emerging contaminants (e.g., trichloroethylene-tce and

and 2) did environmental changes create stresses that caused  eventual site abandonment? we hypothesize that: 1) periods of environmental stability coincided with  increased maize production, larger population sizes, and monumental earthen-work construction and 2)  rapid environmental change and/or degradation destabilized maize production and consequently the  populations surrounding moundville. we will analyze multiple variables that serve as proxies for past  environmental conditions (e.g. organic matter source, soil erosion, lake productivity, fire history,  agriculture). they include: 1) stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter, 2) grain size  distribution, 3) magnetic susceptibility, 4) charcoal particles, 5) pollen assemblages, 6) cyanobacteria  pigments, and 7) fecal sterols. additionally, we will compile existing archaeological literature on the  demography of the local and regional populations as well as collaborate with representatives of  muskogean-speaking tribes affiliated with moundville to include indigenous traditions and culture  histories associated with the region. in combination, these analyses will provide insight into the  relationship between environmental conditions, maize agriculture, and settlement at moundville.  intellectual merit:  while some paleoenvironmental records exist to provide context for archaeological investigations at  mississippian sites, there is still considerable room for additional studies to answer crucial questions  regarding the relationship these societies had with local landscapes. changes in populations dynamics  from 1100 to 1450 ce occurred throughout the se us, but the driving force behind these changes is  unclear. our primary objective is to determine the extent to which environmental conditions influenced  shifts in agriculture and demography at moundville. most critically, our research will provide new  information about the moundville site without invasive excavations within the site itself. our broader  expected intellectual outcome is the identification and development of useful tools for inferring human  impacts that can be applied at a wide range of mississippian sites throughout the se usa, again yielding  information without destructive methods. furthermore, by examining climate/environmental conditions  before, during, and after occupation at the site, we will be able to document how human activities  modified landscapes and local aquatic ecosystems, and how the environment recovered following the  cessation of such activities.  broader impacts:  understanding how societies responded to past climate change and/or local environmental degradation is  important for understanding how future environmental challenges might impact populations. our  information will be shared with monthly updates to federally recognized tribal nations with several  representatives being directly involved with both sampling and interpreting the data. the collaborative  approach will provide much needed insight into how belief systems and cultural norms translate to the  archaeological and environmental record. this research will also contribute to our understanding of  paleoclimate in the se us, a region where late holocene temperature and precipitation changes are not  well-constrained. one graduate student from the lead institution and two undergraduate students from  each collaborating university will be recruited and trained and gain experience in working on an  interdisciplinary project. recruiting efforts will target students from underrepresented groups. project  outcomes will be summarized in a display at the moundville archaeological park museum and a live  webinar will be held, recorded, and archived on the museum’s website.

(2013) genesis pathway framework. as a second step, we will compare high error vs.  low error forecasts within each genesis pathway, with particular focus on the trough induced and weak tropical transition pathway, in a composite storm and shear- relative framework.  the goal of this step will be to evaluate whether there are specific aspects of the pre-tc structure and environment that are more likely to be associated with large errors and thus may suggest specific processes that might be responsible for the less skillful forecasts. finally, we will utilize gfs and prototype hafs ensemble forecasts of a select set of tc genesis forecasts characterized by large forecast variability, particularly from the trough induced and weak tropical transition pathways, to study the factors that govern the predictability of genesis forecasts in each pathway.  the outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the processes that are limiting tc genesis predictability in gfs and hafs, and additional diagnostic tools for the metplus system for tc genesis validation.",

will be on celiac disease (cd) for medical diagnostics whilst fingerprint (fp) and saliva evidence will be used for forensic applications. for these purposes, a range of biological fluids will be purchased from a single source, the samples will be thoroughly analyzed using surface assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (saldi-ms), raman spectroscopy (rs), resonance raman spectroscopy (rrs) and deep uv raman resonance (duvrr) techniques in collaboration between kuwait university and university at albany. magnetic nanomaterials will be prepared and characterized using different analytical instruments. thereafter, they will be employed as substrates for saldi-ms for forensic and medical diagnostics applications. their efficiency and reproducibility will be

preparation and handling yet sample mapping is essential to study the distribution of metabolites in the sample of interest. finally, advanced statistical analysis including chemometrics, univariate

principles and techniques to matters of criminal justice, primarily focusing on the collection, examination, and analysis of physical evidence. biological stains are present in many violent crime scenes and can provide critical data to investigators that directly affect the speed and costs of the investigation, quality of prosecution or defense, and court outcomes or conviction rates. however, serology testing capabilities for these stains are currently limited. supremetric is developing the first universal method for non-destructive, confirmatory identification of all main bodily fluids in biological stains uncovered at crime scenes. the proposed technology utilizes raman spectroscopy, a non-destructive method for molecular structure analysis, paired with a unique, multi-use software platform/advanced algorithm for the generation of multi-dimensional spectroscopic signatures for complex multi-cell biological substances. the data generated by this new technology will support the future development of advanced technologies that can be taken into the field for real time collection and analyses of bodily fluid traces from crime scenes, providing more accurate dna profiling data, and improving the work of crime scene investigators and law enforcement agencies. the proposed research will significantly advance the field of crime scene investigations, providing an advanced and unprecedented identification of bodily fluid components that will lead to the streamlining and acceleration of dna analysis.  the proposed study is an applied research project of on-going work. this research involves systematic studies for the continued development of an easy-to-use and portable raman spectroscopy method for the rapid, nondestructive, and confirmatory identification of body fluid traces recovered at crime scenes. this universal methodology will allow investigators to identify all major body fluids using one instrument and retrieve information about the donor. this will potentially include sex, race, and age. the goals for this applied work will address the analysis of complex biological evidence that discovered at scenes. complex biological evidence are body fluid traces that have been deposited in non-ideal conditions. this includes body fluids deposition on porous substrates, aged samples, and those exposed to crime scene contaminants.  this will be achieved in four main goals. first, (1) we will investigate if the time since deposition of saliva and semen can be determined, both in ambient conditions and under specific environmental conditions. second, (2) we will investigate how the deposition of forensically relevant body fluids on porous surfaces affects the ability to determine their time since deposition. third, (3) we will determine how the use common enhancement techniques affects body fluid identification using our current statistical model. finally, (4) we will create a comprehensive model that considers multiple external conditions at once.  for the goals involving time since deposition analysis, fresh samples will be collected from multiple donors. this is to guarantee that the body fluids are never frozen and that no anticoagulants are present, which are in commercially purchased samples. for the other goals, body fluid samples will be purchased from a biological supplier to represent a genetically diverse donor population. samples will be measured using a raman microspectrometer and the spectra will be analyzed using advanced chemometrics and statistical modeling. regression and classification models will be built using calibration datasets and then tested with external validation datasets to strengthen the reliability and validity of the analysis. the work will be carried out over three years at the university at albany, state university of new york, in albany, ny. all data will be stored as raw spectra and all subsequent steps of analysis will be saved. additionally, the results from the proposed work will be submitted in semi-annual and final progress reports to the nij, published in peer-reviewed academic journals, and presented at professional conferences.  a saliva screening test for alzheimer's disease diagnostics early diagnostics proposes to develop a novel saliva-based test for early diagnosis of alzheimer's disease (ad) based on raman spectroscopy. the non-invasive, inexpensive test, using an easy-to-collect sample and thus widely available at clinical points-of-care, will enable clinicians to monitor the brain health of patients as they age and detect ad before neurodegeneration becomes severe. ad is a progressive and incurable neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of neurodegeneration-induced dementia in the elderly population worldwide. ad is the sixth leading cause of death in the u.s and affects an estimated 5.7 million americans. there is no straightforward test to diagnose ad; rather, doctors must rely on a series of tests to define an ad diagnosis and rule out other possible causes for the symptoms. biomarkers of neuronal loss and protein deposition-such as hyperphosphorylated tau concentration and β-amyloid ratios-assessed by neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) or blood analysis are increasingly being used to diagnose ad. however, the validation of their clinical use is still incomplete. in addition, this complex diagnosis process is only plausibly performed after the onset of symptoms, even though ad likely begins years before clinical manifestations arise.  methods for diagnosing ad early in its progression, which would allow the initiation of disease-modifying treatments before severe, irreversible brain damage has occurred, are lacking. early diagnostics aims to address this critical pain point using raman hyperspectroscopy. owing to its ability to produce a spectral fingerprint that represents the total biochemical composition of a sample, raman hyperspectroscopy offers a unique diagnostic solution based on the combined contribution from several biochemical markers of the disease. the etiology and pathogenesis of ad are highly complex and only partially understood; therefore, diagnosis tools that integrate multiple biomarkers, such as raman hyperspectroscopy, have the potential to greatly improve accuracy, efficacy, and sensitivity of diagnosis, particularly in the early stages of the disease. raman hyperspectroscopy collects multiple spectra from individual points of a sample, which is used to construct a three-dimensional hyperspectral data cube. early diagnostics is applying machine learning to elucidate the spatial distribution of biochemical components in the 3d data. we have already demonstrated that raman hyperspectroscopy-in combination with machine learning-has the potential to detect changes in biological samples during the onset and progression of ad in preliminary studies that examined blood and saliva collected from normative, ad, or mild cognitive impairment (mci) individuals. in this project, early diagnostics will develop a saliva sample collection protocol, spectral data analysis process, and machine learning algorithm optimized to detect spectral fingerprints associated with ad and perform a proof-of-concept study using patient samples to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. by developing a widely available, non-invasive tool for the early detection of ad, early diagnostics will enable clinicians to diagnose the disease with increased accuracy and sensitivity, improving patient outcomes, and accelerating the development of new therapeutics for ad by offering an efficient method for monitoring the efficacy of new drugs and selecting candidates for clinical trials. the technical objectives and challenges early diagnostics' goal is to develop a novel approach for diagnosis ad-and possibly other types of dementia-based on the total biochemical composition of saliva using near-infrared (nir) raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning. our hypothesis is based on preliminary results showing that nir raman spectroscopy detects specific changes in the biochemical composition of saliva associated with ad. these changes affect the raman signature, and a machine learning model can be trained to identify spectral differences that distinguish them. the main advantage of using raman spectroscopy is its ability to obtain specific information through the measurement of spectra from multiple positions within a heterogeneous sample, providing a statistically significant characterization of the sample's heterogeneity and multicomponent biochemical composition. it can detect a biomarker present at a very low average concentration by acquiring raman spectra from a small area containing the biomarker at a high local concentration. our innovation relies on a novel method that uses solid samples, such as dried blood serum or saliva, to prevent biomarkers from leaving a small volume interrogated by the focused laser light during the acquisition of an individual raman spectrum. the method involves automatic mapping to obtain multiple spectra from each sample, thereby acquiring an accurate representation of its compositional heterogeneity. to determine which portions of the spectra are informative, we apply an algorithm to reduce the variables that will be examined by an artificial neural network (ann) classifier, trained to distinguish signatures associated with the various stages of ad. in this phase i project, early diagnostics will de-risk the sample collection and processing, which are critical for the success of the approach, then perform a small study to demonstrate feasibility. this will be accomplished through the following key objectives: objective 1: optimize conditions for obtaining and measuring raman spectral data. a method for preserving saliva samples for nir raman spectroscopy will be optimized. parameters for measuring raman spectral data, including laser excitation wavelength, laser power, accumulation time, number of accumulations, spectral range, and number of spectra measured from each sample will be optimized. objective 2: develop machine learning approaches to analyze spectral data. we will optimize the spectral data preprocessing and develop a robust machine learning approach that provides the best ad screening accuracy. objective 3: conduct a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of our approach. saliva samples will be obtained from prospectively evaluated patients with mild to moderate ad who meet the ad criteria established by the national institute on aging and the alzheimer's association, as well as healthy patients with normal cognitive function as controls. performance of the model will be evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. we will also evaluate sample-to-sample consistency by comparing multiple samples from the same patient taken over time. the method will be evaluated against other blood- or saliva-based methods to demonstrate superiority. optimization of the sample processing and analysis methodology and proof-of-feasibility studies performed here will position early diagnostics to collect a large dataset for algorithm training in phase ii.

particularly for solar and wind energy prediction. the project leverages theory and algorithm of differential equation and optimization to develop a new class of implicit neural networks for renewable energy prediction. this project will synergistically integrate three pis' expertise and introduce critical innovations in the following three research areas: thrust a. developing a novel integration of nodes and deqs leveraging insights from proximal optimization algorithms to boost the expressivity of nodes and suitable for learning irregularly sampled time series from complex physical systems. moreover, we will explore data-efficient learning by integrating self-supervised learning into the proposed implicit neural network. thrust b. generalizing the proximal integration of nodes and deqs to multivariate time series using the efficient self-attention mechanism. also, we will develop novel data imputation algorithms using sparse optimization and adversarial learning. thrust c. application to solar and wind energy prediction with validation on benchmark datasets, and developing efficient, portable, scalable, and gpu-accelerated software that integrates our proposed implicit neural networks for renewable energy prediction.  broader impacts: algorithms developed under this program will have broad-reaching applicability to the maintenance of power system and protection of environment and fight for climate change. our proposed research is data-driven and computationally intensive to prepare a large and diverse workforce of future scientists and engineers. our project will directly support and train multiple graduate and undergraduate students each year. we will also launch a visiting program to support students at the three universities. we will particularly encourage participation from under-represented groups in stem disciplines. moreover, we will implement our algorithms into existing popular deep learning software (pytorch, tensorflow, and jax) and open-source related codes for the scientific community.  keywords: renewable energy prediction, implicit neural networks, deep learning ",

    "robert miller": "           the discernment process of hiv+ black gay men considering  injectable hiv treatment  robert l. miller, jr., ph.d. the school of social welfare the university at albany the state university of new york rmiller@albany.edu  introduction black gay men have been managing hiv for more than 40 years. entering and remaining in care while adhering to their  hiv medication regimen support their durable viral suppression. the availability of once-daily pill chemotherapies also facilitates their adherence. the food and drug administration has approved long-acting injectible hiv therapies. the once-a-month or once every other monthly injection potentially replaces daily hiv pill consumption. some questions include (1) what hiv life history experiences will influence the acceptability of long-acting injectables for black gay men as they maintain their drug adherence and continued durable viral suppression; (2) how do black gay men achieve viral suppression in light of the persistent structural impediments of culturally incongruent health care systems they negotiate, and what meaning do the men attribute to the viral suppression and (3) does that meaning influence the acceptability of the available injectable hiv chemotherapies? this proposal seeks funds to collect narrative data on the life histories of 30 black gay men living with hiv disease. the data from this proposal will describe how the survivors got into care, their experiences in care, their medication adherence, and their discernment of the influences facilitating the acceptability of long-acting hiv medications. these pilot data will also be used to further refine salient research questions for future research. black gay men (bgm) have been burdened by hiv disease since its reporting in the united states. of the first ten men reported to have the virus, four were black (gavett, 2012). further, in 1987, the new york times reported the aids-related death of a black teenage boy in 1969 (kolata, 1987).  in 2016, of all the gay and bisexual men living with hiv, black gay men accounted for 38% of men with the disease. (cdc, 2018).  before the advent of and especially after the antiretroviral treatment (art) development, while not routinely reported, black gay men have also experienced durable viral suppression (, kersanske, wolfe, braunstein, haardörfer, jarlais, campbel, and cooper; 2017).   literature review  men who have sex with men represent approximately two percent of the us population and yet account for 70% of hiv infections (singh, mitsch, and wu; 2017). black gay men in the united states bear a disproportionate burden of hiv and have high rates of unrecognized and untreated hiv infection (cdc, 2005; st lawrence, kelly, dickson-gomez, owczarzak, amirkhanian, and sitzler; 2015).  while sexual risk behaviors among black and white men are similar, black gay men are significantly less likely than white men to take art, experience both more discontinuity of care and premature mortality (pellegrino, 2021), and experience less durable viral suppression (beer, bradley, mattson, johnson, hoots, and shouse; 2016).  viral suppression is recognized when someone has less than 200 copies per milliliter of the virus at their most recent viral load test. to have two or more undetectable test results over six months indicates durable viral undetectability/suppression (mugavero, napravnik, cole, et al.; 2011). durable viral suppression is a goal because it both diminishes the ability of the virus to harm the person's body and reduces the ability of the hiv+ for the person to effectively transmit the virus to another person. the centers for disease control and prevention (2019) report black gay men as less likely to experience less viral suppression when compared to other groups.   challenges to viral suppression and medication adherence   medication adherence supports viral suppression efforts.  substance abuse, financial constraints, social support, hiv stigma, depressive symptoms, employment status, long-distance, side effects of drugs, and pill burden, all significantly impede successful art utilization (paramesha and chacko, 2019). while fewer men are affected by the following, the empirical literature does report drug resistance mutation in a sample of men also mediated an ability to achieve viral suppression (chen et al., 2016).   medication adherence and viral suppression varies according to race.  black gay men are reported to have less education and insurance than their white-counter parts (beer, oster, mattson, and skarbinski; 2014). the same study suggests competing needs particularly around attaining stable housing, food security, and money are more challenging for black men. black gay men experience more challenges with their provider and institutional encounters, more stigma related to serostatus disclosure, and suggest less perceived social support when compared to other gay men (arnold, weeks, benjamin, stewart, pollack, kegeles, and operario; 2017) all impacting medication adherence.   ryan white program participants are more likely to achieve viral suppression (sheehan et al., 2020). however, black ryan white participants report less trust in their physician providers and are consequently less likely to achieve durable viral suppression (saha , jacobs,  moore, & beach 2010). also, the persistence of hiv-related external and internalized stigma remains salient. in one study, while black men were aware of the availability of testing and knew testing locations, many-voiced great personal ambivalence about being tested, feared knowing their hiv status, expressed concern about stigma and loss of confidentiality, and held beliefs indicative of medical mistrust (st lawrence, kelly, dickson-gomez, owczarzak, amirkhanian, and sitzler; 2015). finally, feelings of anxiety or depression, difficulty sleeping, receiving, or needing mental health services were associated with decreased odds of sustaining viral suppression (sheehan, et al. 2020).   known attributes of those who achieve durable viral suppression  while the empirical literature has identified underachievements of durable viral suppression for many black gay men with hiv in the united states, there is scant literature identifying the attributes of virally suppressed such men. being enrolled in the affordable care act is associated with sustained viral suppression (sheehan et al. 2020).  further, many are routinely young and in care. of those in care, more than half report no missed visits in the past 12 months, experience provider self-efficacy; possess a college degree, and report neither recent marijuana nor methamphetamine use (hightow-weidman, legrand, choi, egger, hurt, and muessig; 2017).   despite what is known about durably virally suppressed black gay men, there is insufficient structural and personal (i.e., supportive medical personal, social supportive networks, strategies to manage stigma and other societal oppressions) data to more fully understand how black gay men make decisions resulting in long term hiv suppression. the federal guidelines specify steps potentially resulting in viral suppression: (1) hiv testing and diagnosis; (2) getting and keeping people living with hiv in medical care; (3) prescribing hiv medicines; and (4) helping patients to achieve viral suppression (cdc, 2014). while these guidelines provide an overview of attaining viral suppression, they are less helpful in either identifying the barriers to completing these steps or identifying strategies for overcoming the impediments to suppression. there are multiple questions regarding the history of their suppression namely were they consistently or episodically suppressed and what meaning do they attribute to that portion of their adherence history.  there are also questions related to the inclusion of treatment advances, which may support increased durable suppression   treatment options the food and drug administration approved an injection prescription regimen to treat hiv-1 in adults as a replacement for their current hiv-1 treatment. the injection contains cabotegravir and rilpivirine. the most common adverse reactions (grades 1 to 4) observed in ≥2% of subjects receiving cabenuva were injection site reactions, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness, and rash (fda, 2021).  there is scant literature identifying the challenges of these men as they live longer. how have they resolved to live while so many of their friends and lovers have died? how have they been able to access and utilize various supports?  to the extent the absence of disease does not necessarily portend robust health, this study is designed to both examine the behavioral experiences of men who have achieved durable viral suppression as well as understand the psycho-social experiences and meanings they attribute to living with hiv for more than 25 years. the analysis of the behavioral experiences and the long-term survival meaning for these men may illuminate the factors that will influence their decision to utilize the long-acting injectables? at this writing, there is no empirical literature describing whether and how such options are viable and acceptable for black gay men. consequently, the specific aims for this narrative life history case study of long term virally suppressed black gay men are to synthesize and interpret their (1) thoughts on cues to action in light of their experience of hiv symptomology and testing history, (2) experiences with barriers and supports in achieving hiv viral suppression and the meaning they attribute to their viral suppression; and (3) decision-making process of the acceptability and utilization of long-acting injectables in sustaining their viral suppression. such empirical data will provide additional support in achieving the goals of  ending the epidemic by illuminating some relevance to potentially identifying and negotiating the psycho-social skills in supporting a recent hiv maxim of undetectable equaling untransmissible among black gay men.   methodology this qualitative study will solicit a stratified sample of 30 black gay men.  half of the men will have been living with the virus for 25 years or more. the effort to recruit men with 25 years or more with the virus will provide insight into the segment of men who are continuously aging with hiv. these data will further augment the history of hiv among black gay men, which is lacking in the current hiv literature.  the other half will have been living with hiv for less than 25 years.  their life history narratives data (cresswell, 2013; stake 1995) refer to the course of experiences in an individual life (runyan, 1982, p.83). recounting their life histories will provide opportunities for self-construction, which provide a sense of self-coherence.  this coherence becomes self-evident as they potentially recall their suffering, their survival stories, and potentially moments where they are thriving in their lives (veglia and difini, 2017).  in addition to the individual interviews, two focus groups will be conducted. the explicit use of group interaction to produce data and insights that would be less accessible with the interaction found in a group (morgan, 1988) will further support the individual data. the goal is to have the same informants who participated in the individual interviews to participate in the focus groups. however, if they cannot make the time commitment, men who fit the inclusion criteria for the individual interviews will be solicited for the focus groups.  sample selection, recruitment, and sample size purposive sampling (patton, 1993) will establish the sampling frame by \"identifying information-rich cases whose study will illuminate the questions.\"  two groups of fifteen informants are sought. the sample size is developed against the constraints of funding (enough money to pay the informants) in an effort to achieve data saturation. half of the sample will be composed of men living with hiv for 25 years or longer. the other half will be living with hiv for a lesser amount of time.some black gay men have been living with hiv before the development of antiretrovirals. their data describing how they managed hiv before art are salient. given the complexity of the question and the variation of historical contexts experienced by the informants, primarily due to the longevity of suppression, a homogeneous sample is desired. the sample is specified through the development of tight inclusion criteria (fullilove, 1998). following these inclusion criteria, men who: (a) are at least 25; (b) half of the men will claim an hiv positive serostatus for 25 years or more  (c) the other fifteen will be have been living with hiv for less than 25 years, (d) have two zero viral load tests within the last six months (there is no expectation that the informants have sustained durable viral suppression for 25 years); (e) are psychologically capable of engaging in a conversation; (f) was born in the united states and claim united states citizenship; (g) identify as black gay men; (h) have access to video conferencing technology such as zoom or other modalities; (i) are currently not utilizing the long term injectables;  and (j) speak english. recruitment  initial informants will be recruited from hiv service provider agencies within the capital district of new york as well as in new york city, specifically within manhattan and brooklyn. in the capital district, targeted agencies will include in our own voices, the capital pride center, the alliance for positive health, and the damien center in albany and schenectady, new york. in new york city, the targeted agencies will include gay men's health crisis, unity fellowship, brooklyn aids task force, and services and advocacy for glbt elders (sage) in harlem.  flyers will also be distributed to organizational representatives, who suggest these various organizations are connected to potentially164 black gay men in the various organizations who are potentially durably virally suppressed (stone, 2019). snowball sampling will continue to secure the desired sample size or until data saturation (bowen, 2008) has been achieved.  additional recruitment efforts will employ social media, specifically facebook.  the author is a founding member of the black gay research group, which supports a facebook page for african american gay hiv researchers.   moreover, in 1999, the author collected dissertation data on black gay men who were living with aids. several of those men are alive. given the goal or the research as well as my prior research relationship, their participation is reasonable and likely. if these data collection efforts do not both yield data saturation and the suggested sample size, recruitment through social media will continue to be employed. data collection in-depth interviewing the study will employ in-depth interviewing (seidman, 1997) using a three-interview format (schuman, 1982) with black gay men living for 25 years or more. the first interview explores and clarifies the past, which informs the present.  the second interview provides the narrator with a time of reflection upon what he is doing in his life now. the third interview focuses on the participant's understanding of his experience. in all three interviews, the participants are making meaning. putting experience into language is a meaning-making process (vygotsky, 1987).  the very act of providing a description or telling a story provides insight into how the informant understands and makes meaning of the event he is describing. that these men will provide the stories of their lives, and they will also identify the strategies they used to survive. these survival stories will remind them of their emotional and psychological strength. it will also potentially allow them to talk about events they have not discussed previously.  taken together, their various stories will have bearing on their long-acting injectable decision making.   interviewing logistics the life history qualitative interview protocols are developed from prior literature (whitehead, 1997; whitehead, peterson, & kaljee, 1994; connell, 1995; majors & billson, 1992; harris, 1992; malebranche et al., 2009).  although interview instruments are not identical across studies, each focused on the social context of durable viral suppression among bgm and included questions about family, race, spirituality, sexual identity, experiences with hiv symptomology, testing experiences, their hiv related medication history, sexual risk behavior their experience of durable viral suppression, their perceptions of long-acting chemotherapies and the meanings they ascribe to the various identified contexts. within the context of the injection's discernment, questions such as how do the men in your sample make life-enhancing and -saving medication-related decisions?   how do your study participants make prescription drug choices among the alternatives?  what are the facilitators for prescription drug use? why do they? what are the constraints (forces and factors that recommend alternatives and rule out others)?  what are barriers (e.g., economic, cultural, situational)?  what interventions do study participants envision and recommend in support of prescription drug adoption and adherence?  and what life course developmental factors are implicated in study participants' adoption and adherence decisions?   data analysis life history narratives using atlas.ti (muhr, 1994) qualitative software package, the researcher will conduct a categorical analysis to explore factors that may influence durable viral suppression, their meaning attributed to long term survival, and quality of life three-stage analytic coding strategy that includes open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (corbin & strauss, 1990; strauss & corbin, 1990) will be used. the verbatim transcripts will be fractured into discrete segments, which will be sorted into categories, thus facilitating a comparative examination across participants of how hiv symptomology, stigma, and their encounters with their providers and the medical establishment may influence the acceptability and accessibility decision making of the injectables for the informants.  codes related to contextual factors will be identified through open coding and data immersion by three raters (lovejoy, watson, lacy, and riffe, 2016). through axial coding, a 3-tiered coding hierarchy will be developed based on themes that emerge during the open coding process. a final codebook with codes organized according to this hierarchy will be applied to the data for the final round of coding. during the final round, one rater (the researcher) will code all transcripts, and a second-rater double-coded 20% of the transcripts. cohen's kappa strauss & corbin (1990) will be used to test inter-rater reliability. for selective coding, the final stage of analytic coding, and a theoretical framework through the identification of a core category/theme that is systematically related to all previously identified codes will be developed.  \"story-telling memos\" (malebranche et al. 2009) written throughout the two prior stages of the coding process that contained emerging research questions, speculations about participants' variations in response to or in the expression of phenomena, comparisons to theory, recurring themes, and possible relationships among major categories will be developed. the themes and relationships will be highlighted as strategies to improve sustained viral suppression within the informants and others like them.  focus group data analysis  content analysis and discourse analysis will be conducted with verbatim transcripts. first, the focus group data will be sectioned off organizing the text according to the question, the speaker, and the answer. the verbatim transcripts will be fractured into discrete segments, which will be sorted into categories, thus facilitating a comparative examination across participants according to their profession. places of agreement and disagreement will be noted. the analysis used for the individual interviews will be replicated in this analysis.   the themes from the individual interviews and the focus groups will be organized according to a concept map (fullilove, 2022) will is a helpful way to look at connections among diverse pieces of data. using the specific aims, key concepts will be identified, and those additional concepts will be organized to propose formulations and a conflation of both data sets in the service of addressing the specific aims.  upon completing the analysis, the themes will be organized according to the specific aims of the study. potential problems and solutions recruiting 15 black gay men living with hiv for 25 years or more will not be a problem. those who have lived for 25 years or more or dealt with this population are hopeful for the efficacy of the drugs. the challenge is making them available to the larger populations. the recruitment of the younger men will be facilitated by workers in places like gmhc who are receiving care in various hiv service organizations. public health impact/next steps the impact of this work is found in making the quality of life increases available for populations that have been disproportionately overburdened by the disease course, from their losses of friends and lovers to the virus, the challenges of accessing medical care from systems they don't trust or have treated them inconsistently and without cultural congruence. an effort to understand how these men managed the challenges and how they persisted in choosing to access health care is an important data set. understanding the structural and personal resources they accessed to achieve viral suppression is an essential data point. such data will further illuminate strategies to support these men as they continue access to care, sustain viral suppression and do so with the access to pharmacological innovations. these data will further refine strategies to support black gay men persistently overburdened by hiv disease.    references  arem h, nakyanjo n, kagaayi j, mulamba j, nakigozi g, serwadda d, quinn tc, gray rh, bollinger rc, reynolds sj, chang lw aids patient care stds. 2011 dec;

    "changhwan lee": "project summary / abstract notch signaling is a highly conserved cell-to-cell signaling pathway that is critical for metazoan development, with its dysfunction leading to a variety of human diseases including cardiovascular disease and cancer. our ultimate goal is to understand the molecular principles that control the notch signaling responses and their consequences in the native context and to develop new strategies to alleviate defects caused by aberrant signaling. notch triggers transcription of target genes, which often produce diverse outcomes depending on context such as the tissue type or developmental stage. however, notch research has heavily relied on indirect, translational reporters and in vitro systems. also, the molecular mechanisms of disease-causing notch mutations are poorly understood. our overall objective is to use direct, real-time transcriptional reporters and investigate the in vivo notch responses to wild-type and pathological notch signaling during development and in adulthood. our preliminary results establish powerful, innovative assays using direct transcriptional readouts and examine new aspects of in vivo notch responses such as dynamics of notch-induced transcriptional bursting. with this unique approach, we found that notch-induced transcription is highly dynamic and differentially regulated within a tissue, unexpected results from previous in vitro studies. for our in vivo study, we will use the nematode c. elegans, with a focus on its germline stem cells (gscs), which recapitulates mammalian stem cell niches where notch is crucial for stem cell regulation. notch requires four key components for its transcriptional activation: the ligand, the receptor, the transcription factor csl, and the co-activator maml. our preliminary results show that each component contributes to the notch response differently. our central hypothesis is that each pathological notch mutation in these key components affects the notch transcriptional dynamics in a unique way, leading to distinctive pathological conditions. we will test this hypothesis in various normal and pathological in vivo contexts. aim 1 will dissect dynamics of notch-induced transcription from multiple notch target genes simultaneously, monitor the notch response through c. elegans development, and interrogate the notch response in another system, vulva. aim 2 will determine the in vivo notch responses to pathological mutations, especially notch mutations causing cardiovascular disease (cvd). we will use existing notch mutations, introduce new mutations recapitulating human cvd mutations, and humanize c. elegans notch receptors to directly examine human cvd mutations in the organism. the proposed research is significant as it will define new molecular mechanisms of transcriptional dynamics regulation and determine the in vivo mechanisms of pathological notch mutations with a potential to discover new therapeutic targets for notch-related disease, especially cvd. our work will also provide new disease models and tools for investigating other cell-cell signaling responses in vivo.

2022       description and explanation of changes, if any, made during this budget period affecting the following: goals and objectives; projected timeline for project implementation; and approach and strategies proposed in the initially approved and funded application.  project overview:  the aim of project access is to provide timely and responsive hiv prevention navigator services to undergraduate and graduate students from racial/ethnic minorities at highest risk for hiv and substance use disorders enrolled at the university at albany, state university of new york, a diverse public institution of higher education that offers access to excellence and career opportunities for students from racial and ethnic minorities hailing from areas that are hardest hit by the hiv epidemic (bronx county, kings county, new york county, and queens county). the project will use a navigation approach which engages hiv prevention navigators and peer support specialists representing racial and ethnic minorities with lived experience with substance use disorders and hiv to expedite services for our target population; this will be accomplished by linking our students to on-campus prevention efforts and community services addressing substance use, hiv, and viral hepatitis. the project will also provide training and education focused on the risks of substance misuse and hiv/aids to our entire target population and facilitate vital linkages to treatment services for our students with hiv. additionally, training on hiv and viral hepatitis screening will be delivered to on-campus and off-campus partner medical/social services providers who deliver services to this target population as part of this project.   specific project goals include enhancing timely access to and responsive follow-up across the substance use disorder and hiv spectrum of services by students within the target population, reduction of consumption of alcohol and other substances (including opioids) and related health consequences, increasing abstinence, reducing other hiv risk factors, and sustaining coordinated, timely, and responsive screening and treatment access for both substance use disorders and hiv. this project has been developed through a strategic planning process involving a range of campus and community stakeholders in response to a critical service need as documented by assessment data suggesting that an increasing number of our students are arriving on campus with established high-risk substance use patterns and hiv risk requiring comprehensive, accessible, and timely screening and follow-up treatment, in combination with data from the new york state department of health indicating that the capital district is seeing the greatest increase in prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (stis), including hiv.  partner agencies for this project include the albany medical center hiv/aids medicine program and young adult program, the damien center, and the alliance for positive health. changes during the project reporting period:  goals and objectives; no changes.  projected timeline for project implementation; and no changes.  approach and

months of this project have been focused on project startup efforts. these have included compliance with all conditions stated in the notice of grant award, participation in required and optional onboarding and training sessions offered by samhsa including spars training, and development of operational infrastructures to offer seamless service delivery to the target population of university at albany racial and ethnic minority college students. connections with project partners have been made, and the project consultant and project graduate assistant have been hired. the recruitment and hiring process for the lead prevention navigator is in progress and has experienced delays as a result of challenges associated with the covid-19 pandemic which are outlined in section d of the project narrative.  the project director (pd), dr. cimini, and project evaluator (pe), dr. martin, have been meeting on a weekly basis since the august 31, 2021 grant start date to coordinate project startup tasks with a particular focus on project evaluation. dr. martin has worked with the project graduate assistant, evan ozmat, to build seamless data system infrastructures for data collection, data analysis, and reporting of project data to samhsa through the spars portal. drs. cimini and martin, as well as mr. ozmat, have completed the required spars training for this project.   dr. cimini, the project director, has secured spaces at the university at albany for the lead prevention navigator to provide services to the target population in a timely and responsive manner, the lead prevention navigator will be housed in locations that are easily accessed by members of the target population while, at the same time, offering the necessary confidentiality for individual interactions and service provision. individual service delivery is anticipated to begin in february of 2022. population-level service delivery for the target population has been in progress since the inception of the grant through ongoing health communication efforts, social norms interventions addressing substance use, and population-level screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (sbirt) addressing substance use.   c. summary of key program accomplishments to date and list of progress.  the table below provides a listing of key milestones that have been accomplished since the

planned goals and objectives including: barriers to accomplishment; and actions to overcome difficulties.  background:  the university at albany center for behavioral health promotion and applied research has, during the past 15 years, implemented grant projects funded by samhsa with dedication and excellence. reports from government project officers have consistently been outstanding, indicating that our agency has met and exceeded expectations. beyond the significant impact that samhsa support has provided the university at albany with regard to vital student services in the areas of suicide prevention and screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment, our efforts have been disseminated nationally through publications and conference presentations. the sbirt intervention developed under one of our samhsa grants has been listed in samhsa's national registry of evidence-based programs and practices and has earned 13 awards for innovation in behavioral health. we stand ready to move forward with the same level of dedication, engagement, and enthusiasm with the present project as we have with our prior projects.  barrier:  while we have achieved nearly all of the designated milestones for the present project during the startup phase, to date we have not been able to hire the lead prevention navigator; we attribute this challenge to the unprecedented circumstances that we, as well as other colleges and universities across the nation, are facing as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. more specifically, many health and student services professionals have been leaving colleges and universities due to burnout related to the pandemic, resulting in more available positions than candidates to fill them. the challenges that we have needed to address and the operations that needed to be reimagined and reconfigured were immense, and the physical and emotional toll that this pandemic has taken on our staff and the health and well-being of those managing these pandemic-related challenges have been significant.  during the past four months alone, we have made two failed attempts to hire a prevention navigator and have encountered barriers associated with both the recruitment of a robust applicant pool as well as with identifying strong candidates to which we can offer this important position.   actions to address barrier:  to address this recruitment and hiring barrier, we have taken the following steps:  move forward with the lead prevention navigator search using new recruitment strategies, such as sharing the job announcement with specific contacts on our project advisory council and work through the relationships with potential candidates that they have; placing our project graduate assistant, evan ozmat, to fulfill prevention navigation duties on a temporary basis until a full-time lead prevention navigator is hired;  please note that, per university at albany and research foundation hiring processes, it will require at least four months to complete a staff search and place a lead prevention navigator on this project.   therefore, based on current hiring delays and the standard length of searches at our institution, we anticipate that we will need to request carryover funds from year 1.  e. report on milestones anticipated with the new funding request.  the milestones anticipated with the new funding request will focus on the transition of this project from phase i startup to phase ii project implementation. these milestones are anticipated to be launched in the spring of 2022 and will be in progress over the next four years, until the closeout phase of the project begins in year 5. several milestones outlined below, such as the development of health communication campaigns for hiv and substance use prevention, have target dates for development listed in year 2 of the project, but these materials will be evaluated and refined during the course of the project based on input and feedback from members of the target population. of course, project sustainability efforts will remain front and center through the life of the project and will be continuing across all project phases.

abstract  project access (achieving college completion through engaged support services) aims to  expand and enhance service capacity within a peer-led and professionally-supervised collegiate recovery program (crp) designed to address substance use disorders (suds) and co-occurring mental health concerns among college students in recovery at the university at albany (ualbany), a large and diverse public university located within the northeastern united states. supervised by licensed professionals with over 30 years of experience in the oversight of collegiate recovery programs and development, delivery, and evaluation of model evidence-based practices (ebps) for substance use and co-occurring mental health concerns and staffed by peer leaders who are in recovery, project access will reach 180 students per year through a comprehensive, strategic and inclusive peer-to-peer training, support, and advocacy model that will enhance capacity in the following areas: increase access and promote seamless links to campus and community-based substance use, mental health, and recovery support services for ualbany students in recovery from suds and co-occurring mental health concerns. increase access to specialized and supportive on-campus housing options for ualbany students in recovery from suds. increase self-efficacy, leadership skills, academic persistence, retention in college, and graduation from college by students in recovery. enhance and sustain a strong network of students in recovery by training them in leadership, networking, advocacy, and capacity-building skills aimed to help them engage university departments to support the peer recovery program.  the above efforts will provide the project access program the capacity to offer its students in recovery vital harm reduction services as well as a path to increased abstinence and enhanced behavioral health. students in recovery will also experience opportunities for leadership development, academic success, and vital support as they promote an attitudinal and cultural shift on campus and in the local community. the project leadership team, which includes professionals and peers representative of the rich diversity of the campus community who are in recovery, is well-qualified and positioned to oversee planned program capacity expansion based on their content area expertise in the delivery of peer-to-peer services and history of successful implementation and institutionalization of nationally-recognized model ebps.    “project access: expanding and enhancing a comprehensive, coordinated response to   student suicide and substance misuse and abuse on a large public university campus”    abstract  the university at albany, state university of new york (ualbany) proposes to implement   project access (achieving college completion through enhanced support services), a  comprehensive suicide prevention program that aims to reduce the incidence of suicide, suicide  attempts,  and other related risk factors such as alcohol and other drug (aod) misuse and abuse  among its undergraduate and graduate students with a special emphasis on high-risk and  historically marginalized student populations such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning  (lgbq), transgender and gender non-conforming (tgnc), black, indigenous people of color  (bipoc), disabled, and veteran students. located in the capital of new york, ualbany is a large  public institution in which over 40% of its approximately 17,000 students, particularly those  within the above-mentioned sub-populations, are contending with serious challenges such as  poverty, homelessness, and mental health and substance use-related stressors that compromise  their academic and career success and health and well-being and underscore the critical need for  comprehensive and robust suicide prevention efforts on campus. beyond the existing data- informed evidence of needs across these student groups, a fall 2021 faculty survey indicated a  need and willingness  on the parts of both teaching faculty and professional and classified staff to  receive specialized training in supporting lgbq, tgnc, bipoc, disabled, and veteran  students. building on the university’s long history of commitment and national leadership in both  the suicide prevention and alcohol and substance misuse and abuse prevention fields and having  in place a comprehensive prevention program infrastructure consistent with recommendations  from the suicide prevention resource center (sprc) and the jed foundation, project access  will address the following goals:   1. increase collaboration among campus departments and the capital region community to  address current and emerging student mental and behavioral health needs;   2. increase the number of students who are screened and assessed for mental health and  substance use disorders in a manner that is both timely and responsive to their cultures;   3. increase knowledge and self-efficacy of faculty, staff, and students to respond effectively to  students with mental health and behavioral health problems that lead to school failure, such  as depression, substance misuse and abuse and suicidal thoughts and attempts;   4. increase awareness of campus and community resources that can identify, assess and treat  mental health and substance misuse and abuse problems;   5. increase help seeking for mental health and behavioral health problems;   6. decrease suicide attempts and related proximal risk factors that may lead to suicide;   7. institutionalize effective program components and disseminate information at local, state and  national levels.   to address these goals, the project access team will provide gatekeeper training to 200  individuals per year, educational presentations to a minimum of 200 individuals per year, screen  a minimum of 200 students per year for mental health and substance use-related problems and  utilize student-driven social media efforts to disseminate prevention messaging across the  campus community, reaching all students. this project will allow students at highest risk for  suicide and substance use, particularly those who have been historically marginalized, to access  higher education opportunities, be retained in and complete college, continue progress toward  advanced study and entry into the workforce, and experience health and enhanced quality of life.

    "samantha friedman": "redlining policy and later-life mortality: an exploratory analysis of the linked hrs-1940 census data  samantha friedman, janet wilmoth, miriam mutambudzi, rui li      january 23, 2022    previous research has shown that racial disparities in later-life mortality are influenced by events in early life and over the life course. absent from this research is a study of early-life structural racism on later-life racial disparities in mortality. most studies rely on early-life characteristics and interpersonal experiences that are retrospectively reported by respondents. the proposed research seeks to fill this gap by adopting a life-course approach that will quantify the impact of early-life structural racism, as measured by institutional redlining, on all-cause mortality in later life among white and black older adults. we plan to use: digitized historical redlining maps from the 1930s utilized by the federal home owners' loan corporation (holc); restricted health and retirement survey (hrs) data that links respondents to their records in the 1940 decennial census, and hrs public-use file. the racist policy of redlining was born out of the holc color-coded appraisal system and remained legal until the passage of the 1968 fair housing act. the project is innovative because it requires the construction of shapefiles for many 1940 enumeration districts that currently do not exist. these shapefiles will allow us to map the residential location of hrs respondents in 1940 and overlay the holc maps to create a redlining score for each respondent. we will merge the redlining score to the hrs data along with their 1940 census characteristics to perform our analyses. the seed funding would allow us to build a foundation for additional life-course research on racial disparities in mortality, chronic health conditions, cognitive functioning, and alzheimer's disease and related dementias for which we could seek funding through future nih r01 applications. the project fits well with caps's focus on health and well-being and particularly with its cross-cutting themes of the role of policy and the importance of place.

    "brian hong-an tang": "  project summary    overview  this  project seeks  to  improve  our  understanding  of  how environmental  and  internal  factors  influence tropical cyclone downshear reformation, where a new vortex center forms and amplifies  in  convection  displaced downshear from  the  old tropical  cyclone center. hypothesized  factors  include  the  vertical  wind  shear,  ventilation  (the  injection  of  environmental  air  into a tropical  cyclone), and asymmetries in the surface latent heat fluxes, equivalent potential temperature, mid- tropospheric relative humidity, low-level shear, and other variables.   our objectives are to 1) identify downshear reformation and non-downshear reformation  cases that are “similar” to one another, 2) compare hypothesized factors between these cases that  may be important in differentiating whether downshear reformation occurs, and 3) understand how  the new vortex development is governed by relevant factors.   to accomplish these objectives, we will use a combination of observational and modeling  approaches to evaluate the hypothesized factors. reanalysis, aircraft observations, and other data  will  be  used  to composite  and compare  factors  between  downshear  reformation  and  non- downshear  reformation  cases. case  studies  on  select  downshear  reformation  cases that  have  synoptic-scale  interactions, or are  particularly  well  sampled by  aircraft, will  complement  the  composite analysis. high-resolution,  ensemble simulations of  select  cases will  allow  for  a  comparison between ensemble members that do and do not undergo downshear reformation, and  a  vorticity  budget  will  be  used  to  understand  the  development  of  the  new  vortex. additionally,  high-resolution,  idealized  simulations  will be  used  to  assess  the sensitivity  of  downshear  reformation to specific factors.     intellectual merit  the  proposed  work will advance  our  understanding  of environmental  and  internal factors that  influence downshear reformation of tropical cyclones in vertical wind shear. such factors are not  well  understood,  and  prior  research  on  downshear  reformation  has  been  limited  to  a  handful  of  case studies. additionally, we seek to connect these factors to salient features during downshear  reformation, such as intense, sustained, downshear convection and the new vortex development.  this work will fill gaps in the knowledge of downshear reformation and will use approaches not  yet applied to this topic.    broader impacts  the  proposed  work will  have broader  impacts on  the  forecasting community, education  and  outreach,  and  two  graduate  students. first,  better  understanding of  downshear  reformation may  lead  to  improved  situation  awareness and  forecast  tools  that  aid  in  predicting  downshear  reformation, which is challenging to forecast. second, visualizations produced from cases will be  integrated  into  education  materials for our  classes  and  outreach  events. third,  the  project  will  enable the scientific growth of two graduate students, one of whom is from an underrepresented  group, in numerical modeling, data analysis/visualization, and communication skills.    the proposed research seeks to study the effects of ventilation on tropical cyclone (tc) intensity using  observations from nasa’s grip, hs3, and tropics missions. ventilation is the injection of relatively  cool, dry environmental air into the warm core of a tc and acts as “anti-fuel” inhibiting intensification  and increasing uncertainty with intensity forecasts. while ventilation generally inhibits tc  intensification, there are cases where tcs are resilient against ventilation and continue to intensify.  these cases may be caused by larger amounts of moisture near the tc or variation in the vertical wind  structure. a study utilizing observations can reveal more insight into the environmental factors that  cause variation in the impact of ventilation.   previous studies have focused on analyzing ventilation using idealized computer simulations and  measuring ventilation from observations is not well examined. the goal of the proposed research is to  analyze ventilation pathways from observational datasets and to study environmental factors that  influence the variable effects of ventilation on tcs. specifically, the proposed research will seek to  answer the following questions:    (1) at what height does ventilation affect tcs?    (2) what environmental factors influence the impact of ventilation on tc intensity?    (3) how do ventilation pathways differ for tcs of different intensity and stages of the tc life cycle?   three hypotheses are suggested to answer the research questions:   hypothesis 1: tcs are most sensitive to radial ventilation at middle layers of the troposphere   hypothesis 2: the effects of ventilation on tcs depend on environmental factors, including the variation  in wind structure with height and the amount of moisture present in and around the tc.   hypothesis 3: ventilation has a greater effect on weaker tcs   these hypotheses will be tested using observations of ventilation and the tc environment using  measurements of temperature, water vapor, and wind from profilers on the nasa tropics satellites  and a suite of instruments on the dc-8 and global hawk aircraft during the grip and hs3 field  campaigns. the aircraft instruments include the apr-2 and hiwrap radars, lase and dawn lidars,  hamsr and s-his sounders, and dropsondes. additionally, simulations of tcs using the nu-wrf  computer model and reanalysis data from nasa’s merra-2 will be used. hypothesis 1 will be tested by  creating a three-dimensional view of the ventilation structure using hiwrap and hamsr, tropics  profiles, and the nu-wrf model. this will be used to find the height where the strongest ventilation  occurs. the first part of hypothesis 2 will be tested using the dawn wind lidar and merra-2 reanalysis  to study the vertical structure of the wind. the second part will use the lase moisture lidar, s-his  sounder, and dropsondes to measure the amount of moisture in and around tcs. hypothesis 3 will be  tested by analyzing ventilation in both weak and strong tcs. the 3-d ventilation structure developed for  hypothesis 1 will be used. additionally, radar reflectivity profiles from the hiwrap and apr-2 radars will  be used to provide an overview of the tc structure.    the proposed research will achieve nasa’s goal to improve the capability to predict weather and  extreme weather events through the study of how ventilation impacts tc intensification. the proposed  research seeks to develop a framework for incorporating a suite of measurements collected from the  nasa tropics, grip, and hs3 missions, the merra-2 reanalysis, and the nu-wrf model to better   diagnose ventilation, thereby fulfilling nasa’s goal to further the use of earth system science research to  inform decisions and provide benefits to society. the fi is an early adopter for the tropics program and  the results of the proposed research will contribute to its science mission  statement of work university at albany co-i brian tang  co-i brian tang and two graduate students will work on seo objectives within e.6.1: impact of mesoscale and tropical cyclone organization on convection, specifically part three of this section on tropical cyclones. storm-probe data will provide high vertically resolved atmospheric thermodynamic profiles in and near tropical disturbances and cyclones. these profiles will be used to examine environmental interactions and changes in tropical disturbance/cyclone structure in the context of recent advances in our understanding in these areas. the first objective is to examine dry-air intrusion pathways into tropical cyclones, which are imparted by environmental vertical wind shear and are difficult to observe with conventional remote sensing platforms. this examination will be done by analyzing individual cases and compositing data over multiple cases in a shear-relative framework. storm-probe data will also be compared with operational hurricane models to assess how well these models are resolving these dry-air intrusion pathways. the second objective is to examine changes in tropical cyclone structure in various stages of the tropical cyclone lifecycle. ahead of, and during, tropical cyclogenesis, storm-probe data will be used to assess changes in the thermal and moisture structure, specifically the formation of the warm core, moistening of an inner region, and drying of a surrounding outer region. likewise, thermodynamic changes in the structure after tropical cyclogenesis may signal intensity changes associated with changes in vortex tilt and warm-core strength. the investigation will potentially inform the use of storm-probe observations to forecast tropical cyclone formation and intensity changes, particularly where reconnaissance aircraft observations and traditional satellite observations are absent or limited.

    "chang sup park": "  recently, american mainstream media repeatedly highlighted the increasing popularity of korean drama across the globe, particularly in the united states. the global popularity of korean drama is a clear indication of new global, and regional, transformations in the cultural arena. at the global level, it signifies multidirectional transnational cultural flows in which the previous cultural peripheries begin to have a presence and a voice in the cultural centers. this study tackles transcultural reception and evaluation of korean drama by american audiences. why do americans gravitate toward korean drama? although familiarity plays in the consumption of korean drama among global consumers, cultural specificity and uniqueness, may also be an important part of its appeal and reception in the west. theory of cultural hybridization posits that hybridity increases a sense of familiarity and the potential to connect with an international audience. several studies show that korean drama has characteristics of both familiarity and difference. despite the recent attention to this hybrid nature of korean drama, especially the growing body of literature on korean drama's traction in asia, little is known about global audiences' understanding of korean drama.  extending cultural hybridization theory, this study focuses on how americans receive and evaluate the hybrid characteristics of korean drama and how they are drawn to such characteristics. this study expects that the traditional korean values that are integrated into western drama formats allow american audiences to gain a sense of both familiarity and difference. this study also examines how american fans shape or reshape their cultural identity with the exposure to the hybrid, cosmopolitan content of korean drama. it will illuminate how the hybridization of familiarity and difference is an essential aspect of korean drama's global appeal and reception. furthermore, this study aims to contribute to a larger conversation about directions of transnational media flows and media reception in the era of digital media. studying cultural hybridization focusing on american audiences gives us insight into how korean drama can expand its global territory by taking advantage of its unique strengths. to achieve the research goals, this study will employ three methods - (1) participant observation at three american fan sites of korean drama - soompi (www.soompi.com), dramabeans (www.dramabeans.com), and kdramapal (www.kdramapal.com); (2) content analysis of american fans' postings on the three fan sites; and (3) in-depth interviews with 100 american fans to examine their reception and evaluation of korean drama and its impacts on american fans' identities and worldviews. this study will be conducted between february 1, 2022 and january 31, 2023. at least three manuscripts will be written out of the study, and they will be presented at international conferences hosted by the international communication association and national communication association in 2023. the manuscripts will be also submitted to prominent peer-reviewed journals, including international journal of communication, media, culture & society, and asian journal of communication in 2023.

    "michael lesnick": "  abstract my research focuses on topological data analysis (tda), which aims to develop tools for studying the coarse-scale, global, non-linear geometric features of data.  i work on the theoretical foundations of the subject, and also on the computational and applied aspects.  recently, i have focused on the design of practical algorithms and software tools for tda. on both the theoretical and applied sides, i am most interested in projects that promise to advance topology as a useful tool in the study of scientific data. on the theoretical end, my recent work has focused on three closely related topics:  multi-parameter persistent homology; refinements and extensions of the stability theory for persistence; and homotopy-theoretic foundations of persistence theory.  a unifying thread in this work has been the study of interleavings and interleaving distances. these are formal tools for quantifying similarity between the mathematical objects arising in tda. interleavings are used to formulate the algebraic stability theorem,  arguably the central result in persistent homology.  this result provides the core mathematical justification for the use of persistent homology in the study of noisy data. it is used, in one form or another, in nearly all available results on the approximation, inference, and estimation of persistent homology. moreover, interleavings have emerged as the language of choice for formulating generalizations of the persistence theory, e.g., to the multiparameter setting. among  my  contributions  to  the  persistence  theory  are:   a  converse  to  the  algebraic  stability  theorem;  a generalized form of algebraic stability called the induced matching theorem, with a simpler proof (w/ bauer); an extension of forward and converse algebraic stability to the setting of zig-zag persistent homology (w/ botnan); a universality result for the multiparameter interleaving distance; an analogous universality result on filtered spaces for a homotopy-invariant version of the interleaving distance (w/ blumberg); stability and robustness results for the 2-parameter persistent homology of point cloud data (w/ blumberg); and most recently, an lp-type extension of the interleaving distance on multiparameter persistence modules, together with corresponding stability, universality, and isometry theorems (w/ bjerkevik). on the applied side, my focus has been the development of practical algorithms and software for 2-parameter persistence.  i am a co-designer/developer of rivet, the first practical, publicly available software tool for the visualization  and  analysis  of  2-parameter  persistent  homology.   the  main  algorithmic  advance  of  rivet  is  an efficient (cubic time) algorithm for computing a minimal presentation of persistent homology (w/ matthew wright). another recent focus is efficient computation of the multicover bifiltration, a density-sensitive extension of the usual union-of-balls filtration with strong robustness properties.   this proposal describes a research and education program aimed at transforming the theory and practice of topological data analysis (tda) through the development ofmultiparameter persistent homology (mph). tda extracts multiscale information about the shape of a data set by construct- ing a diagram of topological spaces from the data.  the standard example is persistent homology, which constructs afiltration, i.e., a diagram of the formf 0 ↪→f 1 ↪→f 2 ↪→ ···,and then applies homology to obtain signatures calledbarcodes.  barcodes are widely used in applications, but have two key limitations: first, standard constructions of the filtration are unstable to outliers; attempts to remedy this require the choice of a parameter whose appropriate values can be unclear.  second, a single filtration often cannot fully capture the structure of interest in the data. mph, which associates to the data a multiparameter diagram of spaces, provides a principled approach to overcoming these limitations.  it is particularly promising for clustering problems and for dynamic data. yet mph has so far been applied only infrequently to real data analysis problems. a key difficulty is that there is no fully satisfactory generalization of barcodes to mph; this creates major challenges for the development of mph as a practical data analysis methodology. the pi is at the forefront of a broad effort to address these challenges:  he has produced the- oretical  and  algorithmic  results,  as  well  as  novel  software,  which  amount  to  the  beginnings  of  a principled, practical framework for mph. this work suggests that a future is within reach where mph is more useful than ordinary persistent homology and has a decisive impact on mainstream data science.  yet to reach this point, major further progress is needed.  this proposal puts forth several related research objectives at the interface of theory, computation, and applications, each aimed at realizing the potential of mph. in addition, the pi proposes several educational and outreach activities aimed at broadening par- ticipation in mph research and making advances in mph accessible to a diverse, multidisciplinary audience.",

university of new york co-pi, deb jaisi, university of delaware co-pi, yaoze liu, university at albany, state university of new york co-pi, michelle c. mack, northern arizona university unfunded collaborator: xiaojuan yang, oak ridge national lab   abstract: terrestrial ecosystems are often phosphorus (p) limited and internal p recycling (via litter decomposition) is the main p input into soil and largely regulates soil p availability and primary productivity. wildfire can induce lasting impacts on p cycling within burned environment, primarily through immediate changes of aboveground p pools and ecosystem characteristics that affects internal p recycling and p loss. despite long-term wildfire research, a mechanistic understanding of fire's impacts on p cycling remains lacking, particularly considering complex interplay between fire, weather, vegetation, and soil on fire severity and ecosystem response. this impedes our ability to evaluate the magnitude and longevity of fire's impact on soil nutrient biogeochemistry and predict the trajectory of plant nutrient limitation. this proposed research is the first effort to characterize and integrate biogeochemical and hydrological processes controlling the transport and cycling of p in fire-impacted ecosystems, built on multidisciplinary expertise and extensive relevant experiences of the team and ongoing long-term research on an experimental forest. we will first explore the interplay between fire and vegetation and the impacts on aboveground p pools and chemistry, through field and laboratory measurements of ash and charcoal production and p partition, as well as characterization of p speciation and mobility of ash and charcoal derived from different fuel sources and fire conditions. we then explore the transport and cycling mechanisms of ash/charcoal-derived p in soil profiles and the impacts on soil and plant nutrient stoichiometries, through integrated experimental and modeling studies. specifically, we will characterize depth-resolved p pools and identify the contribution of ash/charcoal-derived p at >30 field sites with different fire histories (1 to 150 years after disturbance). pathways and rate of p transport will be experimentally investigated via column experiments and long-term p transport under different scenarios (e.g., varying plant uptakes and soil properties) will be simulated, and the results will be compared to that of field analysis. watershed-scale hydrologic and water quality modeling will be performed to estimate the dynamics of p loss from burned environments (and evaluate the impacts of fire-altered factors), which is an integral part of the p cycle and often enhanced by fire. our multi-scale and systems approach will lead to mechanistic insights into the fire-perturbed p cycle and enable the evaluation of post-fire p cycling dynamics under varying fire conditions and ecosystem characteristics. such information will be used to improve model representation of p cycle responses and feedbacks to fire in the energy exascale earth system model land model.    internship summary    1  dcl 21-013  non-academic research internships for

examples of an  inland pine barrens ecosystem on earth, which is a fire-dependent and fire-maintained ecosystem.  the apbp commission has been actively using prescribed fire to restore the ecological  processes that originally shaped the pine barrens and the impacts of prescribed fires on the  ecosystem are under monitoring. lingqun will work with research staff at the apbp to study the  impacts of prescribed fires. as an education intern, lingqun will work under the mentorship of  the apbp education program staff, to develop and deliver indoor and outdoor activities for  ongoing and future educational programs at the apbp discovery center. the collaborative  design and development of educational programs will provide opportunities for developing fire-  and climate-related educational activities, and original stem education research.   the internship is highly synergistic to our nsf award that aims to understand the impacts  of pyrogenic carbon on soil biogeochemistry and to educate the public with several important  and relevant topics, such as fire, global carbon cycle, and climate change. at the completion of  the internship, lingqun will have: 1) acquired field research skillsets and learned about the  collection, analysis, and management of data for ecological management, 2) conducted research  on the impacts of prescribed fire on soil and biota at the apbp, 3) designed, prototyped, and  implemented educational activities, and 4) worked with the apbp staff to develop broader  impact opportunities. the internship will significantly benefit lingqun’s dissertational research,  by linking laboratory and field research on fire. in addition, it will provide him invaluable  professional development opportunities. indirect outcomes of the internship include an expansive  network for future collaboration on both research and outreach with not only the apbp, but also  other groups that actively engage in the apbp, such as local schools, and research groups from  the union college and rensselaer polytechnic institute.

    "melinda larsen": "abstract  the goal of this recode proposal is to engineer functional organoids that recapitulate the complex salivary gland architecture in a controlled and stereotyped manner. in this application, interactome-aware analysis and machine learning using single cell rna sequencing transcriptomes and microarray data derived from developing secretory salivary epithelial cells and organoids will predict critical signaling nodes that are aberrant in organoids.  experimental manipulations in organoids will validate signaling nodes by activation or inhibition with viral constructs. salivary gland development requires the orchestration and cooperative signaling of the epithelium with stromal niche cells. receptor-ligand analysis will be used to define stromal niche factors that may impact epithelial differentiation and discrepancies between the transcriptomes of salivary gland stromal cells and in vivo will be used to define factors that will be experimentally validated. engineering of organoids in mini bioreactors that support both the stromal and epithelial cell states to facilitate cell-cell communication and facilitate controlled development of uniform organoids. the process that we develop for optimizing robust, stereotyped salivary gland organoids will inform our knowledge of salivary gland development and will be adaptable for directed differentiation of other organoids. this project will involve convergence training of women and minority students to diversify the future multidisciplinary stem workforce.    cellular plasticity in salivary gland regeneration_pis ovitt and larsen_larsen sow  aim 1: determine the role of cellular plasticity in the response to salivary gland injury. the larsen group will perform ductal ligation and deligation surgeries using our established protocols on adult males and females for both mist1crert2;rosa26tdttomato and axin2creert2:rosa26tdt mice.  salivary glands will preserved as cryosections, and immunohishtochemistry will be performed using sections from preserved salivary glands using our established methods. lineage tracked acinar and ductal cells expressing tdtomato (from mist1crert2;rosa26tdttomato and axin2creert2:rosa26tdt mice, respecrtively) will be examined for loss of diffrentation markers, entry into cell cycle, and evidence of lineage conversion, indicative of cellular plasticity.  aim2: analyze lineage plasticity and regeneration of salivary glands with single cell resolution. the larsen group will perform single cell rna sequencing of cells isolated from mouse salivary glands after regenerative and non-regenerative gland injuries using our established methods. the larsen group will perform the ductal ligation and delegation surgeries for the regenerative injury mouse model, and will receive irradiated mice provided by the ovitt lab for the non-regenerative injury model. these studies will employ c57bl/6j, mist1crert2;rosa26tdttomato, and axin2creert2:rosa26tdt mouse strains to facilitate sequencing distincet timepoints coupled with lineage tracing as in aim 1.  aim 3: investigate the potential for repairing radiation-damaged salivary glands by stimulating endogenous regeneration. the ovitt lab will perform the animal work for this aim. the larsen lab will perform immunohistochemistry on cryopreserved glands provided by the ovitt lab.

    "julia hormes": "  the individual suffering and public health burden associated with anorexia remains substantial and current treatments have limited effectiveness. comorbid exercise dependence is common in anorexia, exacerbates symptom severity, and predicts poor treatment outcomes. patients with anorexia typically present as perfectionistic, intolerant of uncertainty, and heavily invested in routines. exercise dependence is similarly characterized by the need to perform exercise in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, suggesting that a lack of flexibility is a crucial transdiagnostic mechanism that links the two conditions and should be targeted in treatment. this application seeks funding for a study designed to evaluate the initial efficacy of cognitive remediation therapy in patients with comorbid anorexia nervosa and exercise dependence. cognitive remediation therapy is typically delivered as an adjunct to treatment as usual and focuses on increasing patients' cognitive flexibility through engagement in a variety of tasks that require increasingly complex mental abilities and encourage the development of meta-cognition by asking patients to \"think about how they think.\" we hypothesize that the intervention will result in improved treatment engagement, and, ultimately, decreased eating and exercise symptom severity. we further hypothesize that intervention efficacy will be mediated by an increase in cognitive flexibility. as a secondary aim, we seek to establish two novel biomarkers, namely salivary oxytocin and heart rate variability, as reliable and valid indices of cognitive flexibility. the proposed project will be executed in collaboration with albany medical center, livewell intensive outpatient program, children's hospital of philadelphia, and the university of north carolina.

    "matthew crayne": "project abstract  the department of homeland security's (dhs) workforce is challenged each day with safeguarding americans from myriad threats to personal safety, democracy, and national security posed by terrorists both domestically and abroad (dhs, 2021). preventing acts of terrorism requires the complex and rigorous scientific study of terrorism in all its varied manifestations, necessitating the recruitment, selection, and retention of a high-functioning and resilient workforce. terrorism researchers must systematically evaluate the propaganda, ideologies, and psychologies of actors who seek to launch terrorist attacks. this content is inherently value-laden and possibly personally troubling, causing these individuals to confront potential violations of their \"sacred\" or \"protected\" values such as the preservation of life (e.g., tetlock et al., 2000). indeed, prior research has highlighted the significant trauma that conducting terrorism research can cause to the researcher (conway, 2021; king, 2018; massanari, 2018; winter, 2020), establishing clearly that there are inherent psychosocial risks embedded into the nature of this essential work. however, despite this acknowledgement there remains no consensus or systematic study on the forms of trauma that terrorism researchers are exposed to, how such trauma may differentially manifest as a product of the type of research that is conducted, or the short and long-term personal and workforce consequences of trauma exposure.  in response to this pressing issue, in this study we combine traditional industrial/organizational (i/o) psychology methods with emerging research on moral injury and other psychosocial hazards to examine the manifestation and consequences of trauma in those who study terrorism and targeted violence. specifically, and in partnership with six (6) national and international terrorism-focused research centers, including four (4) ncite partners, this project proposes two distinct and connected phases of work. first, a series of job analyses will be conducted to identify characteristics of the form and structure of terrorism research work that present systematic risks for psychosocial trauma. this framework will then be used as the conceptual basis for a series of experience sampling studies conducted with working terrorism researchers across various career experiences and trajectories. this will identify both within-person and between-person trends in experience with potentially traumatic material, as well as the individual, environmental, and work-context factors that are predictive of negative workplace (e.g., turnover intention) and interpersonal (e.g., burnout) outcomes. this will identify potential intervention points for future efforts to build resilience to psychosocial trauma in the terrorism research workforce. the value proposition of this study is that the prevalence of psychosocial trauma in the terrorism research workforce presents a critical threat to the dhs science and technology directorate (s&t) terrorism prevention and counterterrorism research (tpcr) center of excellence (coe). specifically, by enhancing prevention of, and resilience to, psychosocial workforce threats this study supports the dhs tpcr coe mission to develop a skilled workforce trained in the latest methods to identify and respond to terrorist threats (tpcr nofo, p. 9) and the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism (2021) need to \"enhance domestic-terrorism related research and analysis\" (dhs, 2021).

structural racism indicators improves ts, ml, and dl algorithms to predict adverse perinatal events and to create and evaluate use of dashboard and technology platforms to reduce adverse perinatal events in at-risk populations and communities.     aim #1: examine whether and how incorporating social determinants of health (sdoh) indicators improves traditional statistics (ts) and machine learning (ml) algorithms to predict adverse perinatal events in new york city (in particular, central brooklyn), new york state, and the united states.  aim #2: evaluate whether and how incorporating structural racism indicators improves ts and ml algorithms to predict adverse perinatal events in new york city, new york state, and the united states.  aim #3: create and assess dashboards as well as technology platforms for various stakeholders to effectively and efficiently reduce adverse perinatal events in at-risk populations and communities in new york city, new york state, and the united states.    c.8. specific aim 3: conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal and key stakeholders' perspective following methods of our previous studies.108  we aim to provide a comprehensive cost-effectiveness of the place-based bk3mp intervention group (n=400) compared with the bk3mp control group (n=400). the economic analysis will be presented in terms of the cost- effectiveness and cost consequences of achieving improved health and social outcomes compared with the usual standard of care. the specific objectives are: (1) to calculate the direct and indirect costs of implementing the intervention compared with the cost of the usual standard of care; (2) to estimate the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of primary outcome and secondary outcome measures; (3) to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) between the intervention and standard care approaches and build decision tree model for cost-effectiveness analysis; (4) to run 1-way, and 2-way sensitivity analyses on important variables to test the robustness of our main findings from cost-effectiveness; and (5) to recommend the best possible approach for improving women's health.              we plan to take societal perspective, hospital's perspective, and payer's perspective in our economic evaluation.  the intervention is defined as an innovative multicomponent, coordinated community health workers (chws) supported pathway completion (closing loop in care) designed to address basic survival needs to promote early prenatal care. the comparator is standard case management. the study population are women 18 years and older, self-report black, english or haitian creole speakers, committed to deliver at uhb, or kc, or brooklyn hospital, and or brookdale hospital, residing in a central brooklyn zip code, and self-report pregnancy gestation <=18weeks. the time horizon for the economic evaluation is up to 2 months post-partum. baseline characteristics of all women will be collected and measured at the enrollment at t1, follow-up reminders and financial incentives will be sent to all study subject at the midpoint of the whole study period to prevent loss to follow-up. all the primary (late <third trimester>/no prenatal care) and secondary outcomes (prenatal care utilization defined by apcui, severe maternal morbidity, obstetric comorbidity index, perinatal outcomes, unmet needs, perceived stress) of all women will be collected at t2.                we will include direct cost and indirect cost when a societal, or hospital, or payer's perspective is adopted. the study will collect all costs relevant to running the innovative intervention program (program-related costs) and costs born by the study participants (participant's costs). the program-related costs are derived from detailed program budget lines and other relevant administrative cost data as well as application of micro-costing methods to collect information from semi-constructed interviews with key personnel including all chws, study subjects, community-based organizations, project coordinator, budgeting team, nowpow© team, providers, and payers with regard to their work (including training activities and community outreach activities) and activities related to this proposed study. and transportation cost, meeting time, family members' time, and caregiver's time (including doula's time if applicable) will be systematically recorded. all the cost will be calculated or adjusted for productivity change or loss based on the bureau of labor's contemporary statistics. as the study period is short, there is no need to adjust for price inflation and discount. summary tables and figures will be used to present the base case cost-effectiveness analysis and the comprehensive sensitivity analyses. we plan to use treeage pro healthcare software for this economic evaluation.

    "prinkle sharma": "  project summary even though driverless cars are still at the advance testing stage, semi-automated driving tech- nology has been around for half a decade. some manufacturers even produce cars capable of driving without intervention, but they prefer to brand these capabilities asdriver assist technologydue to regulations and possible safety issues. the driver assist technology relies on several sensors and ac- tuators such as radar, lidar and cameras to monitor the driving environment to warn or intervene. many regular vehicles have also been updated by the manufacturers to keep up in the competitive market with wireless connectivity, radar, lidar and cameras to offerdriver assist technologies. cyber attacks have become one of the major threats in today’s iot world, and vehicles are no exception. government agencies and automotive industry can benefit significantly from digital forensic techniques both in hardware and the planning and decision mechanism of av to mitigate cyber attacks and improve reliability of these systems to protect health and safety of passengers, as well as to strengthen law enforcement and to deal with liability issues that will arise in the future. however, digital forensics research is not widely employed in transportation infrastructure. we propose a transportation infrastructure support system that can (i) transfer event and au- tonomous decision logs to the cloud in the absence of cellular connectivity to provide inter-operability via blockchains, (ii) process decision logs to identify the root causes of an accident due to benign, malicious or faulty inputs, and (iii) build an ai-based forensic investigation framework for au- tonomous vehicles. we will develop methods to transfer data through different vehicle makes and cellular service providers securely and consistently in real-time. therefore, in the event of a traffic accident in a location without cellular connectivity, relevant data can be transferred for further processing and forensic analysis. we will also focus on the decisions black-box ml mechanism make from the perspective of forensics to reveal the input and decisions that led to an accident. keywords:cyber-physical systems; intrusion detection; data science, ml and ai intellectual merit.the proposed research will improve civil transportation infrastructure by (i) uncovering the black-box of the ml-based decision making mechanisms for forensics purposes, (ii) preserving and protecting crucial cruise and autonomous decision logs by transferring information to infrastructure in the absence of cellular network, and (iii) lay out foundations for standardized forensic investigation of avs in case of attacks and accidents. the project will advance the science of explainability for the decisions made by avs based on benign, faulty or malicious inputs, which will be essential to understand the reasons for an accident due to an incorrect decision and also to improve the algorithms in order to prevent further similar mistakes. furthermore, the project will advance the state of vehicle to infrastructure communication via a secure inter-service operability mechanism enabled by blockchains to supply forensically-relevant information in real-time rather than post-event. broader impacts.in 2021, hacker groups successfully conducted cyber-attacks on critical in- frastructure, pipelines, meat manufacturers, and state government systems. it is only a matter of time that they start to use the vulnerabilities in driver assist technologies as a weapon to threaten, disrupt and interrupt traffic and transportation infrastructure. state troopers and other first re- sponders are neither equipped nor ready to forensically investigate accidents and car wrecks for semi or full avs. even if they were equipped, the roads are not ideal environments to perform forensics operations. our system will (i) carry essential forensic data to the cloud and infrastructure even before an accident happens, and (ii) explains the decisions made by black-box ml mechanisms with- out requiring the manufacturer. this project will produce open-access documents and open-source tools to advance science in this area, contribute to at least 3 ph.d. dissertations, 3 undergraduate projects, and 3 m.s. thesis, while encouraging underrepresented populations into stem research through several synergistic activities. summary – 1",

project title: distributional consequences of electrifying the trucking industry  investigators: dr. cuicui chen (lead pi), cchen27@albany.edu; daiqiang zhang (co-pi),  dzhang6@albany.edu  institution: state university of new york at albany, albany ny 12222    project period and location: january 2023 – december 2025, albany ny   project cost: $394,628    project summary:  the study aims to (1) understand how charging infrastructure affects the adoption of electric  trucks and the associated spatial distribution of local air pollution, and (2) identify charging  infrastructure designs that best deliver on the environmental justice goal of truck electrification.        our research approach involves four steps. first, we use the restricted-use commodity flow  survey (cfs) data to estimate a transport mode choice model. the model captures how shippers  trade off fuel cost against shipping time when choosing among existing modes (rail, air, truck,  and water). second, we construct various infrastructure scenarios of charger power, battery  capacity, battery efficiency, and charging locations.  in each scenario, by adding electric trucks  as a new mode to the transport mode choice model, we predict which shipments will be chosen  by shippers to be electrified, third, we simulate the associated changes in the spatial distribution  of local air pollution. tailpipe pollution from trucks decrease, but power plant pollution may  increase to supply electricity for truck charging. these changes are spatially distributed and can  affect underserved communities very differently from other communities.  we evaluate the  pollution damages for various communities using the ap3 air pollution model. fourth, we  combine those model outputs with the restricted-use american community survey (acs) data to  quantify the inequality effects of truck electrification. we do this by adapting the inequality  framework from the theoretical economic literature to (1) collapse two-dimensional inequality  (monetary income and pollution damages) into a one-dimensional measure; (2) decompose total  welfare into inequality and income size; and (3) examine how inequality changes within and  across various sociodemographic groups. applying the framework across infrastructure scenarios  allows us to identify infrastructure designs that best achieve environmental justice goals.       we expect to produce three main results. these results correspond to the first three research  areas in this rfp. first, we assess the pollution and economic effects of truck electrification on  underserved communities.  second, we identify charging infrastructure designs that best reduce  inequality and improve welfare under truck electrification. third, we quantify the factors that  drive the adoption of electric trucks by estimating a transport mode choice model.     supplemental keywords: ambient air, mobile sources, health effects, population, age,

interests in truck electrification.  disadvantaged communities tend to live close to truck traffic and experience a disproportionate  share of truck pollution. achieving environmental justice under truck electrification requires a  careful design of truck charging and power transmission infrastructures, with a thorough under- standing of how shippers and power dispatchers use those infrastructures. this project seeks to  identify charging and transmission infrastructure designs that improve environmental justice under  truck electrification. we integrate power systems engineering expertise with an economic analy- sis that features novel data, empirical estimation, and micro-founded theory. our integrative and  human-centered approach consists of four steps. first, we estimate a model of shippers’ transport  mode choices based on the restricted-use commodity flow survey data. second, we construct var- ious charging infrastructure scenarios and predict which shipments will be chosen by shippers to be  electrified. third, we simulate how electrified shipments change the spatial distribution of tailpipe  and power plant pollution. to simulate the latter, we draw from engineering expertise in develop- ing a power dispatch model with customizable dispatcher objectives. the model identifies areas in  which new transmission lines would be valuable and inform new transmission infrastructure designs.  lastly, we identify charging and transmission infrastructure designs that best achieve environmen- tal justice. we evaluate infrastructure designs under a suite of socially meaningful metrics adapted  from the theoretical economic literature: inequality, income size, welfare, and decomposition of  inequalities within and across sociodemographic groups. intellectual merit our project quantifies the role of charging and transmission infrastructures in achieving environ- mental justice under truck electrification. we show how infrastructure designs interact with shipper  and power dispatcher preferences to produce desired outcomes. existing studies have ignored ship- per preferences by imposing exogenous electric truck adoption rates (e.g., full electrification of the  national truck fleet). in practice, shippers endogenously choose which shipments to electrify, based  on the technical feasibility and economic attractiveness of electrifying each shipment. we also de- velop a detailed national power dispatch model with customizable dispatcher objectives. it will be  publicly available to facilitate future research on the social impacts of transmission infrastructure.  finally, we construct a micro-founded measure of environmental justice. it can be broadly applied  in other contexts. existing work on environmental justice focuses on manifestations of environ- mental injustice (e.g., a certain sociodemographic group experiences more pollution than others).  our quantitative measure of environmental justice allows researchers to systematically rank and  optimize policies on environmental justice. broader impacts  policymakers and disadvantaged communities look forward to electric trucks as a solution to envi- ronmental injustice, but scientific guidance on how to deliver on this goal is scarce. we engage pol- icymakers and disadvantaged communities throughout our project, from identifying infrastructure  challenges, incorporating field knowledge, to informing their decision-making, with presentations,  policy memos, and analytic tools. these products enable stakeholders to assess, design, and advo- cate for environmentally just infrastructure development in the electric truck context and beyond.  activities under this proposal also result in teaching material on environmental justice and promote  diversity in the economic and engineering profession by supporting a female pi and several phd  students. the pi and co-pis are dedicated to broadening participation by underrepresented groups  through formal hiring and formal and informal mentoring. b–1",

    "mariya zheleva": "  project summary overview: the ever-growing demand for wireless data has led to a corresponding increase in demand for – and congestion of – the radio spectrum.  unlocking the potential of the next-generation wireless systems will require the adaptability, flexibility, and performance benefits made possible by dy- namic spectrum sharing.  at the same time, scientific spectrum users, such as radio astronomy, have vastly expanded their observing frequency range as well as their instantaneous bandwidths. this performance increase simultaneously enriches their measurement capabilities and makes them more vulnerable to both in-band and adjacent-band interference. satellite-based non-terrestrial net- works are increasingly operating near radio astronomy protected frequency bands, resulting in an extremely high potential for unintended interference. in order to fully achieve the vision of spectrum-hungry next-generation wireless systems, active and scientific users must coexist in ways that guarantee equitable access to spectrum.  operating these future systems will require new and innovative real-time spectrum awareness, coordination, and sharing techniques that can operate in highly dynamic environments. sharing and coordination is especially important for satellite-based non-terrestrial networks given the longevity of their orbital lifetime and difficulty of mitigating interference into a radio astronomy observatory. this proposal explores the potential of a cognitive passive spectrum awareness and coordination scheme that will allow a satellite non-terrestrial network to share spectrum with a ground-based ra- dio astronomy observatory. our approach is based on each system’s ability to sense the presence of the other without the need to utilize a third-party spectrum administrator. the proposed architecture will enable autonomous and seamless coexistence between bandwidth-intensive spectrum users. intellectual merit: this work addresses theoretical and experimental issues surrounding the coexistence of highly- sensitive radio astronomy receivers and satellite-based non-terrestrial networks being deployed to provide ubiquitous wireless service. our approach explores a fully autonomous mutual sensing and coordination scheme that allows both the observatory and satellite to detect the presence of the other and to share the protected and adjacent bands. our framework will simultaneously allow the satellite to maximize its use of the spectrum and minimize or prevent any unintended interference from harming the observatory’s measurements. furthermore, our objective is to develop and implement these algorithms using off-the-shelf measurement hardware, ensuring that they work with limited or incomplete spectrum information. our research will be tested experimentally in conjunction with a participating observatory, with the experimental results being integrated into theoretical models for continuous improvement and testing. broader impacts: the research addresses the global need for ubiquitous wireless broadband by dynamically and au- tonomously enabling coexistence of active and scientific users of the spectrum in and around pro- tected frequency bands.  the result is an expansion of access to the spectrum for both active and scientific users. active users gain spectrum near protected bands, while scientific users could take advantage of the dynamic coordination to temporarily operate outside of their protected frequencies. this expanded access would improve broadband wireless service deployment worldwide, providing economic and technological improvements to under-served areas.  the proposed work has educa- tional impact at suny albany and the u.s. naval academy through the incorporation of material into courses as well as undergraduate student projects. 2",

    "maria delos milagros gasco-hernandez": "  civic-pg track b: fighting urban inequity in small and mid-sized cities  through affordable strategies combining artificial intelligence, rich data  and the co-creation of targeted interventions    overview:   in the last decade, new inequities in cities have been forged, resulting in unevenly distributed  opportunities in service provision and resource allocation that impact citizens’ quality of life and  communities’ resilience. inequity in cities goes hand and hand with a process of decline that particularly  affects certain areas of the city, the poorest ones, which are often characterized by a landscape of  blighted properties as well as of a deteriorating urban infrastructure. the use of rich data may assist local  governments in the recognition, quantification, and documentation of urban blight and deteriorating  infrastructure conditions and, therefore, of potential gaps in residents’ access to essential resources and  service allocation. in this context, the goal of this project is to improve the collection and use of rich data  in decision-making processes aimed at boosting access to services and resources and, therefore, at  improving quality of life in the city, particularly of the most socioeconomically disadvantage populations.  this goal will be accomplished by developing a community-engaged research-centered pilot project in the  city of schenectady, new york (ny), which will be led by researchers at ctg ualbany and personnel  from the city of schenectady. the pilot will focus on 1) the suitability of artificial intelligence (ai)-based  tools in detecting urban blight and significant differences in urban infrastructure and, therefore, in  identifying inequities within the city, 2) the use of data to identify existing inequities in access or  distribution of public services and support government interventions, 3) the engagement of community  organizations in the co-creation of comprehensive strategies to fight urban blight and fix broken urban  infrastructure, and 4) the identification of technological, organizational, political, and social issues that will  impact the deployment and use of ai-based tools. in order to prepare for the pilot, the objective of this  planning grant proposal is to strengthen collaborations with relevant stakeholders, solidify academic and  civic team members’ roles, and refine the vision and plan for executing this research-centered pilot  project.   intellectual merit:   this project will result in the refinement of the community asset tracker (cat), a feasibility prototype,  which demonstrates the capability of a mobile internet of things (iot) sensor to capture the appropriate  imagery and geolocation data throughout an urban environment. this initial prototype includes the  successful application of computer vision and machine learning technology to accurately identify specific  characteristics of blight and infrastructure assessment. it can be easily installed and used on different city  government vehicles that maximize the cameras’ ability to regularly view as much of the city as possible.  further, all the processing of the data is done on the vehicles instead, which makes this strategy scalable  for the whole city. by using the cat, the project will also contribute to ai and data analytics literature,  government information management, and data-driven decision making in the public sector. finally, it will  actively use participatory and action-based research designs and methods that will allow for the  engagement of the community.   broader impacts:   by piloting an ai-based tool in the city of schenectady, ny, this project will study and enable affordable  and efficient data use, reuse, and analytics by different stakeholders, which will eventually lead to the co- creation of comprehensive strategies to fight urban blight, fix broken urban infrastructure, and increase  access to essential resources and services. this will potentially contribute to bridging urban inequity, to  boosting the social and economic revitalization of cities and, in the end, to increasing the quality of life of  citizens, particularly of those residing in blighted neighborhoods, who are usually also the more  socioeconomically disadvantaged. in addition, the project will strengthen current partnerships between  the university at albany and civic organizations in the city of schenectady. scalability and sustainability  of results beyond the 12-months pilot as well as replicability in other cities are also expected.

    "christine smith": "   1  in the 2005-2006 school year, the u.s. department of education (2022) reported that 41.7% of  reporting schools and 75.2% of reporting high schools had one or more “security guards, security  personnel, school resource officers (sros), and sworn law enforcement officers who are not  sros” (table 233.70). this increased to 61.4% of all schools and 84.3% of high schools in the  2007-2018 year with 46.7% and 72% respectively carrying a firearm. despite these large  numbers, a february 2019 report by the commission of the states (cs) noted that only roughly  half of the states required training for sros or ssos (school security officers) and far less  required a certification of some kind (2019).   the national association of school resource officers (nasro) espouses the theory that the  duties of sros are that of “educator, informal counselor, and law enforcement officer”  (canady, james & nease, 2012, p. 3) or the “triad model”. however, upon examination of the  28 states in the afore mentioned cs report, only roughly half of those states required training  topics that could fall under “informal counselor”, or “educator” explicitly noted in statue or law  (2019). this imbalance highlights not only the widespread national need for trainings, but the  incongruence among states. additionally, king and bracy (2019) stated that “improving  communication and relationships between students and adults in schools is one of the best ways  to make schools safer” (p. 287). as such, the goal of this project is to create safe, prepared,  positive and effective learning environments for students in grades prek-12 in the united states  via expert created online asynchronous trainings for school safety personnel nationwide. it is  expected that those that complete the trainings will acquire advanced knowledge in the areas of  student mental health, issues affecting students, student learning and engagement, emergency  prevention, preparedness and management in schools and methods for addressing behavioral and    2  mental health issues and aid school safety personnel in recognizing potential violence through a  trauma-informed non-biased lens.

    "april roggio": "we propose to evaluate the degree to which funding to support entrepreneurship in new york's rural communities has been effective: does it represent an effective architecture, designed to help rural regions thrive? why or why not? and what are particular challenges faced by rural entrepreneurs?  rural entrepreneurs face numerous hurdles, including obstacles related to their ability to secure financial capital for startups, access adequate healthcare, and secure opportunities for a higher education for themselves and their children. perhaps one of the most surprising realities is the alarming food insecurity in rural regions, despite the fact that many of these places have historically been agricultural regions, where food was once abundant and food entrepreneurs, plentiful. new york state offers a unique laboratory to investigate the possible outcomes of efforts to fairly disperse funds to all communities. initiated in 2011, the regional economic development council regions were designed as a way of providing a more equitable and asset-based approach to accessing capital. we are particularly interested in understanding whether the development of this infrastructure was able to produce more entrepreneurial ventures in new york state. using interviews, content analysis and secondary data analysis, and engaged participatory mapping and modeling, we will evaluate how state funding mechanisms have affected entrepreneurship in rural regions. have these funding decisions allowed rural entrepreneurs, particularly those involved in food systems and those who have been historically underserved in rural regions, to sustain businesses, build capacity and thrive?  our project is aligned with the focus area: systems and structures to support inclusive prosperity.   we must have food, but we need to procure it very differently in the future if we hope to maintain a liveable world; but how do we govern food systems effectively? schools have access to two potent leverage points: they are chiefly responsible for the ways in which children are exposed to healthy food; and they are actors in the wider food system, and can shape food system decisions. here we ask how schools are designing policies that nurture food systems that are local, healthy and equitable.  this work will investigate how schools are:  providing nutritious and tasteful foods for the children under their care;  developing educational programming related to healthy eating and living;  engaging with the broader community to build partnerships with food producers, food distributors and retailers, and other food security stakeholders  in particular, we are interested in how well schools are integrated into their local farm and food sector.

    "gabriele fuchs": "overview  ribosomes are required for the fundamental and highly regulated cellular process of protein biosynthesis1. although textbooks portray ribosomes as identical molecular machines that indiscriminately translate mrna sequences into proteins, ribosomes are heterogeneous particles and this heterogeneity is intimately associated with function. while it has been shown that specific ribosomal proteins contribute to preferential translation, the roles of post-translational ribosome modifications in mammalian cells remain mostly enigmatic. the overall goal for this career award is to dissect the functions of ribosome post-translational modifications (ptms) on translation in human cells.  in order to study the function of ribosome ptms, the investigator's lab utilizes poliovirus (pv) as a model. the virus not only shuts-off cellular translation and limits protein synthesis to non-canonical initiation but preliminary mass spectrometry data by the fuchs lab revealed that lysine acetylations increase on many ribosomal proteins during pv infection. interestingly, upon lysine acetyltransferase kat3 inhibition, pv plaque size and numbers increase significantly, suggesting ptms directly influence the pv life cycle. these findings are intriguing but raise many questions. first, which steps of the virus life cycle are impacted by loss in lysine acetylation and is the observed effect virus-specific? second, how does the loss in lysine acetylation affect cellular gene expression and response to poliovirus infection? lysine residues can also be methylated, and by immunoblotting lysine trimethylations change during pv infection, hence mass spectrometry will be used to characterize lysine mono-, di- and trimethylation in uninfected and poliovirus-infected cells. overall, the preliminary data suggests that alterations in ribosome ptms could be widespread and may represent an unknown regulatory and/or stress response system to regulate protein biosynthesis in human cells. intellectual merit ptms are critical modulators of protein function. the mechanistic dissection of ribosome ptm function on translation highlights the intellectual merit of this proposal that aims to advance our knowledge on ribosome heterogeneity. to achieve these goals, we have identified three main objectives: 1) to determine how loss of ribosomal lysine acetylation affects the poliovirus life cycle 2) to identify how loss of ribosomal lysine acetylation affects host cellular gene expression and response to poliovirus infection; and 3) to measure changes in lysine methylation and effect on poliovirus proliferation and identify their mechanism of action. insights gained from this study will transform the ribosome heterogeneity paradigm by illustrating the crucial role of ribosome ptms in controlling translation. broader impacts  the research objectives described in this career proposal integrate biochemical, molecular biology and rna biology approaches. research experiences in these fundamental areas of biology are ideal educational tools and broadly impact students at any level. in a class project termed \"statistics meets biology\" the investigator has teamed up with a local high school math teacher whose students learn statistics by analyzing pv plaque assays and luciferase reporter assays generated in the investigator's lab. through this experience, students experience the real-life application of statistical tools while learning about ribosome and viral biology. further, throughout the year, undergraduate students in the investigator's lab experience and follow the scientific process from developing an idea, executing an experiment and interpreting data. this approach is extended to the investigator's living and learning community (l-lc) or \"world of biology\" freshman seminar series. within the \"world of biology\", the pi has created a unique curriculum and mentoring experience for the l-lc students, with the directive to encourage these undergraduate students to seek out further research opportunities, be inspired by innovative fields of work and pursue future stem education and career opportunities.

    "ting wang": "dna and rna play vital roles in numerous normal and diseased cellular functions and processes through a variety of structures mediated by base pairing, base stacking and other tertiary interactions. regulating different base pairing patterns represents an attractive way to manipulate dna and rna functions. a series of external stimuli, including temperature, ph, small molecule ligands, metal ions, etc. have been developed to control the base-base interactions and the overall structures of dna and rna, achieving gene regulation. the overall goal of this application is to develop new photoswitchable nucleotide building blocks for the regulation of base pairing, dna replication and crispr process. in our preliminary study, we synthesized a hydrazone modified cytidine to control the dna c:g pairing through the e-z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450 nm. we found that the light activated z form isomer could inhibit dna synthesis and cause base misincorporation during dna replication. in this proposal, we will fully extend this strategy by developing new and higher-efficient photoswitchable nucleotides, investigating their biophysical properties and applying them to pcr and crispr systems as new chemical biology tools. comparing to other existing chemical or biological methods, light is an ideal candidate because it is noninvasive, safe to cells, and has a high level of spatial and temporal resolution for in vivo applications. specifically, we will achieve this goal through the following two aims.

    "peter brandon": "integrating social vulnerability into rehabilitation decisions for deteriorating transportation structures  the transportation sector is responsible for the movement of goods and people across communities, and it must be maintained to ensure the resilience of the communities they serve. however, recent events have shown that deteriorated structures such as bridges and culverts are vulnerable to collapse from hazard loads. the intensity and frequency of such loads may increase due to external factors such as climate change, which is not currently included in bridge and culvert design. as a result, communities are tasked with maintaining and rehabilitating this infrastructure to ensure resiliency and sustainability. moreover, we know that some communities are more vulnerable than others. this vulnerability can be holistically expressed through social vulnerability indices which combine a multitude of socioeconomic factors. these indices combine social vulnerability factors (e.g., age, race income) to create a quantitative metric which can be used to decide if one location is more vulnerable than another. however, these indices are not often linked to maintenance and rehabilitation decisions for deteriorating infrastructure. therefore, this project provides equitable maintenance and recovery recommendations which account for both social vulnerability and structural deterioration. this project will focus on massachusetts as a trial case study, but the methodology would be applicable to any community scale.

state university of new york (suny) and operates under the umbrella of the research foundation (rf) of suny, the largest university-associated research organization in the country. chsr is a multidisciplinary research center with over 30 years of experience conducting needs assessments and program evaluations, designing information systems, and informing policy and program development for a broad spectrum of agencies that serve vulnerable populations. chsr is comprised of over 35 researchers, programmers, and faculty from disciplines that include criminal justice, education, psychology, public health, sociology, and social welfare.   chsr conducts applied research on human service programs and systems through interdisciplinary partnerships with government, foundations, and non-government agencies. characteristic of all chsr studies is a focus on rigorous methods, strong stakeholder involvement, and the dissemination of timely, accurate and non-partisan information to guide best practice in service design and delivery.   knowledge and experience evaluating education programs. notably, chsr has extensive experience conducting statewide research projects and evaluations, including needs and gaps analysis and activity progress for the new york state birth through five development block grant, administered by the council on children and families at ocfs. as part of this initiative, staff members created a logic model for grant activities, short- and long-term goals and outcomes, and metrics to assess progress toward defined goals and outcomes.    chsr served as the local school district evaluator for the 21st century community learning centers (21st cclc) in the city school district of albany from 2013-2017. the city school district of albany is a demographically diverse urban school district with an approximate enrollment of 8,000 students. this local evaluation included observational measures to assess program fidelity, a key component in formative evaluations. during this evaluation, staff at chsr also collected both quantitative and qualitative data from programs in six schools, including four elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. data was analyzed and reported to both local and statewide administrators to support program impact at the individual, school, and community levels.  chsr has also completed a number of other educational-based evaluations of expanded learning opportunity programs, including the albany promise cradle-to-career partnership, my brother's keeper milestones challenge grant, and albany city summer youth employment evaluation.   experience conducting formative evaluations. staff at chsr have completed a number of formative evaluations in a variety of areas including juvenile justice, foster care, and health care. typical activities within the formative evaluations completed include the following: literature reviews, analysis of program documentation, key informant interviews or focus groups, and data system reviews.  evaluation approach the evaluation team will utilize a participatory approach to the formative evaluation, whereby key project stakeholders (right to be leadership and staff, curriculum developer, planning and evaluation consultant, project team, advisory committee, irb, schools, teachers, and students) will play an essential role in informing the design and process of the evaluation. the evaluation team will work collaboratively with key stakeholders to design the evaluation plan. during interviews/focus groups, key stakeholders will be consulted about their vision for the 5ds for kids program, including their perspectives on curriculum, program design, implementation, and expected outcomes. the evaluation team will also work alongside project staff and consultants during the implementation phase. evaluation staff will follow the three evaluation approaches outlined by bellwether education partners (2020) for ensuring diverse, equitable, and inclusive evaluation: 1) engage representative stakeholders, 2) ensure quality data, and 3) communicate across differences.  proposed evaluation framework  the expanded re-aim/prism evaluation framework (glasgow et al., 2019) will also be employed to facilitate a systematic approach to the proposed formative evaluation. the re-aim/prism framework consists of factors that are important for program planning and implementation. importantly, the framework will be utilized to create a shared understanding between the evaluation team, program staff, and curriculum consultant regarding the evaluation approach, and will assist in identifying and agreeing upon a comprehensive set of goals, objectives, and methods.   the re-aim framework was developed in 1999 to be used in the evaluation of behavior change program implementation and has since been expanded into the re-aim/prism framework. rather than focusing on just fidelity of implementation and outcomes, the re-aim/prism framework includes individual, program, and contextual factors related to the implementation of a program.   the five central re-aim dimensions allow for examination of implementation at the individual level while also considering the external context where the intervention is being implemented. reach encompasses questions around the population receiving the intervention, such as what are the characteristics of individuals receiving the program?; effectiveness is focused on individual outcomes of the program, these are the expected program outcomes such as, changes in how students respond when observing bullying behavior; adoption describes who chooses to administer a program, for example, what are the characteristics of the teachers who choose to utilize the program?; implementation includes a wide range of metrics including fidelity to the program model, program adaptations, costs, and why results come about as a result of the intervention; and maintenance refers to factors related to getting a program started, making a program sustainable, and a feedback loop of monitoring program outcomes. the prism contextual factors include the external contextual factors related to program implementation, such as policy, resources, guidelines, and incentives that may support or hinder program implementation. it also considers internal contextual factors such as characteristics, perspectives, and structures within a context. one internal contextual factor that is important for understanding the implementation of the 5ds for kids program is organizational and individual perspectives about bullying (i.e., school culture around bullying).   overall research questions the proposed formative evaluation will be guided by the following research questions, which will be further refined after consulting with key stakeholders: what is the design and objectives on the 5ds for kids program and how are those related to expected outcomes? what are the mechanisms in place to monitor implementation and outcomes of the 5ds for kids program? is the 5ds for kids program being implemented as expected? is the program ready to scale up for a full-scale implementation? what are the initial participant impressions and outcomes of the 5ds for kids program?  proposed methods goals, objectives, and methodology table 1 below shows the evaluation goals, objectives, and methods.  table 1. goals, objectives, and methodology  goals objectives activities and data sources  goal 1. gain an overall understanding of the design and objectives of the 5ds for kids program and

be compared across different sources to identify consistent and unique results. employing a mixed methods design will result in a rich dataset that will inform the continued development of 5ds for kids and will provide a broad perspective on the potential outcomes of the program.  evaluation planning and design to further refine the evaluation plan and design, the evaluation team will conduct an environmental scan.  an environmental scan is a multi-method approach for organizing and analyzing information to guide and improve interventions (wilburn, vanderpool, & knight, 2016).  this approach is used to provide stakeholders with contextual knowledge about the issue under study, to identify potential long and short-term shifts and strategies, and to plan for the future of an intervention (graham, evitts, & maclean, 2008). at the end of the environmental scan, a logic model will be created, which will include planned measures for implementation fidelity, dosage, and outcome measures. the evaluation plan will be finalized, and this plan will be used to develop and submit an irb application to the state university of new york, university at albany, institutional review board. once approved, monitoring program implementation can begin.  the environmental scan will consist of the following strategies: literature review.  the evaluation team will conduct a literature review of school-based bullying prevention programs, including recent quasi-experimental studies or randomized control trials. this literature review will provide the team with updated knowledge on the most recent findings and advancements in methodology and outcomes, and this will be shared with key stakeholders and used to inform the evaluation plan.  analysis of program documentation.  the evaluation team will review 5ds for kids documentation (e.g., program manuals), in addition to any documentation used to monitor implementation and outcomes (e.g., implementation trackers, instruments, or administrative sources used to measure school bullying), if available.  the evaluation team will synthesize available documentation to better understand the overall design and implementation of 5ds for kids.  the findings of the document analysis will inform the evaluation team of the program's readiness for implementation and will be used to inform initial interviews or focus groups with program stakeholders during evaluation planning and design. if there are any key elements that are missing, for example, if there is no mechanism in place to monitor implementation fidelity or pre-post student learning outcomes, the evaluation team will work collaboratively with program staff and consultants to develop these materials. key informant interviews with right to be key stakeholders. the evaluation team will conduct key informant interviews or focus groups with right to be staff and consultants.  the evaluation team will develop data collection protocols drawing from a published semi-structured interview protocol.  this protocol consists of items developed to examine program implementation, and to obtain all information needed to construct a comprehensive logic model (gugiu & rodriguez-campos, 2007).  the interviews or focus groups will be designed to obtain information about program implementation, assess data collection capacity, and inform action steps required to facilitate initial implementation.    collect baseline data and monitor program implementation to evaluate 5ds for kids implementation, evaluation staff will work alongside project staff and consultants to observe implementation and pilot data collection measures. chsr will make tools available and provide technical assistance for data collection tools through the implementation phase. the details on how tools are administered will need to be agreed upon when planning the evaluation, but possibilities include paper administration, electronic forms (e.g., fillable pdf), and online survey (e.g., qualtrics).  baseline data collection. chsr will make the baseline measures available for data collection prior to program implementation.  site visit. two members of the evaluation team will conduct a site visit during a week when 5ds for kids is being implemented. evaluators will observe and collect information about how the program materials (e.g., manuals) and monitoring instruments are being used and will collect initial impressions of program curriculum, program design, and implementation. the site visit will provide insight into whether the materials are being used as intended and any ad hoc modifications that are being made.   support collection of tools measuring implementation fidelity and student outcomes: the chsr evaluation team will monitor collection of data during the implementation of the 5ds for kids program and will provide any technical assistance needed. documentation of technical assistance or modifications to procedures will be kept to inform future planning.  collect and analyze data on program outcomes after the program implementation has ended, the final outcome measures will need to be collected from students. then, key informant interviews or focus groups will be conducted to collect qualitative data. while there are quantitative measures collected during this evaluation, the qualitative data is very important in the formative evaluation. the role of the quantitative data is to identify trends in outcomes. the qualitative data will be used to inform any changes that need to be made to 5ds for kids prior to scaling up the program. student outcomes. the evaluation team will collect pre- and post-participation quantitative data on student outcomes. these will consist of student pre-post tests and class/school level data. key informant interviews or focus groups with participants. after program implementation has ended, chsr will conduct focus groups with students and key informant interviews with teachers and school administrators to gather more information about curriculum, program design, implementation, and outcomes. participants will be asked to provide feedback on the curriculum, including what pieces they feel are the most important and any changes they would make. they will be asked about other aspects of program design and their impression of the 'dosage.' feedback about the implementation process, factors that supported/inhibited implementation, and modifications made during implementation will be collected. participants will also be asked about any changes or outcomes they have experienced or observed. these interviews or focus groups will also be used to assess the contextual factors that play a role in supporting/inhibiting program implementation and the mechanisms in place that support/inhibit sustainability of this type of initiative. teachers and administrators will be asked to identify additional action steps needed prior to full program implementation.  data analysis and reporting the chsr evaluation team will meet quarterly during the project year with key project stakeholders to share evaluation progress and prepare for next steps.  after data collection, chsr will synthesize the data obtained during and after program implementation (i.e., site visit, key informant interviews or focus groups, and quantitative tools) to create a final evaluation report. the key informant interviews and focus groups will be transcribed and thematically analyzed. the quantitative measures will be analyzed using an appropriate statistical package (e.g., spss) and summarized. appropriate tests will be chosen to make any statistical comparisons, such as comparing pre-post student outcomes. qualitative and quantitative results will then be compared across data sources to determine consistent and unique findings. differences in findings between groups will be considered. cross-cutting themes, current conclusions, and recommendations on changes to curriculum design, program design, program implementation, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation instruments and methodologies will be made. the evaluation report is to be submitted by the end of july 2023. a corresponding presentation will also be provided.  timeline     project management staff at chsr prefer an approach to project coordination and communication that is both frequent and collaborative.  while chsr staff are experts in developing evaluation plans, data collection and analysis, and report writing, we recognize that we need to work closely with content and program experts to fully understand what is needed and feasible for a project.  our goal is to create an end product (report) that is both informative and useful to the sponsor, which cannot be done without close collaboration with all project stakeholders.  project-specific questions irb chsr falls under the purview of the university at albany institutional review board. irbs typically consider program evaluations to be exempt from review, as they do not meet the regulatory definition of human subjects research (i.e., while they do involve human subjects, they are not designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge). chsr always submits a comprehensive screening form to this body to allow for accurate assessment of each project; turnaround time on this screening form is typically less than 1 week. if it is determined that this project does fall under the regulatory definition of human subjects, chsr will submit a full irb proposal for review and will address any questions and make any modification needed for approval. chsr always complies with the ethical principles and guidelines for the protection of participants and complies with applicable federal and state regulations, such as unbiased selection of subjects (e.g., allowing all program participants to be eligible for evaluation data collection), appropriate participant compensation, informed consent and assent, protection of participant privacy and data confidentiality, etc. all chsr staff are trained in human subjects research practices and trauma-informed evaluation.   other experts/stakeholders chsr is happy to collaborate with right to be's existing advisory board. the project staff bring a wide range of experiences and expertise; other experts are not necessary.  evaluation approach and team members: alignment of values and requested qualifications participatory and inclusive. equity in evaluation is one of chsr's main values. chsr actively works to ensure inclusion of multiple perspectives, in evaluation design, execution, and interpretation. as such, our research design includes funds to appropriately compensate evaluation participants for their time and input, thereby increasing the likelihood that a more diverse set of participants will give their feedback. chsr does not ask participants to share any information not immediately related to the evaluation. chsr also frequently collects data in languages other than english, either by utilizing staff who speak other languages or hiring translators, thus ensuring participation is not limited by language background. chsr also employs a diverse staff and will ensure that project team members represent diverse backgrounds. further the proposed methodology considers differences across groups, which includes differences across race/ethnicity, and considers the potential implication of those differences. chsr is also happy to collaborate with stakeholders and program implementers and participants to shape the evaluation methods and instruments to be culturally and topically appropriate.   consent with research. chsr always follows informed consent and assent procedures. participants are informed as to the purpose of the evaluation, the terms of their involvement (e.g., what participation would entail, that they can chose to end their involvement at any time, that they can participate as much or as little as they would like), procedures for confidentiality, follow-up contact information, and any risks and/or benefits that might follow from their participation. information is always given in non-technical language understandable to the participant. an opportunity for discussion or any questions is always included. as such, potential participants are aware that they may opt out from data collection, request that their data be excluded from analysis at the end of their participation (i.e., retroactively opt out), and/or request that only certain information be utilized.   child safeguarding and privacy. chsr has previous conducted research in school settings with children and minors, including acting as the local evaluator for the city school district of albany's 21st century community learning center program. in this capacity, chsr surveyed students and facilitated focus groups among students regarding their experiences in the program, their favorite and least favorite aspects, and their thoughts on any adjustments needed. data was also collected related to behavioral incidents, student attendance, and individual test scores. chsr also conducts individual interviews with youth with complex mental health needs as part of the evaluation of the new york state systems of care expansion samhsa grant.  chsr always places high importance on data safety and security and participant privacy. all data is stored in highly secure online platforms, access-locked and monitored computer drives, and/or in locked cabinets in locked offices.   chsr qualifications access to, experience with institutional irb 30+ years of experience with the university at albany irb  experience with research and/or

    "beth feingold": "  project summary   cardiometabolic diseases are largely preventable but have remained the leading cause death worldwide for over  15 years. low and middle income countries (lmic) shoulder an increasing majority of this burden. though often  overlooked,  rural,  remote  lmic  regions,  such  as  the  amazon  rainforest,  are  of  particular  interest  as  they  are   undergoing  massive  anthropogenic  changes  (i.e.  resource  extraction,  infrastructure  development  and  rapid   urbanization) and as a result, have increasing availability of, and access to, the western diet.  addressing diet- related health risks associated with the demographic and nutritional transitions in these lmic regions is crucial,  but has been  limited  by  the  lack  of  quantitative  biomarkers  to  measure  dietary  intake.    two  promising  non- invasive biomarkers for this application are carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (cir and nir). the cir is  elevated  in  key  components  (corn,  sugar  cane)  of  the  western,  but  not  the traditional amazonian (cassava,  potatoes) diet. in contrast, the nir is elevated in fish, a key traditional protein, but is not in animal-based foods  characteristic  of  westernization  (e.g.  farmed  chicken,  beef).  thus,  cir  and  nir,  which  are  potentially  more   sensitive and less biased than diet surveys, can provide objective enculturation proxies. while cir and nir have  demonstrated associations with cardiometabolic risks in upper income countries, the associations in lmic have  yet  to  be  investigated.  the central  hypothesis of  this  study  is that cir  and  nir  reflect  the  changing   epidemiological   profiles   associated   with   urbanization   and   infrastructure   development   in   a   nutritionally    transitioning  populations.  the objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  evaluate  changes  in  adult dietary  patterns  and  cardiometabolic disease risk profiles (hba1c, hdl-c, ldl-c, height, weight, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, and  triglycerides)  associated  with  the construction  of  the  interoceanic  highway  (ioh)  through  peru’s  southern   amazon by measuring these biomarkers of the nutrition transition and complementary dietary survey data. this  study leverages two related studies that draw from the same population (combined cohort n=1958) with well- suited highway-adjacent and riverine comparison groups in varying stages of nutrition transition. aim 1 tests the  association between highway exposure and household level western diet adoption using stored samples from  2014.  aim  2  and  aim  3  follow  the  cohort  forward  in  2021  to  test  whether  cir  and  nir  are  associated  with   cardiometabolic risks factors in the amazon (aim 2) and whether large-scale anthropogenic change modifies the  diet-disease relationship (aim 3) using stratified random effects models to account for household and community  clustering. the expected contribution of this research is improved understanding of the specific changes in the  dietary  drivers  of  cardiometabolic  disease  risks  associated  with  infrastructure  development  in  remote  lmic   regions by using novel unbiased dietary assessment tools. this work substantially adds to the limited body of  evidence  on  novel  biomarkers of  the  nutrition  and  transition.  it  and  could  apply  to  other  areas  undergoing   infrastructure development and contribute to effective disease prevention strategies.

    "julie novkov": "project abstract/summary: algorithmic decision-making systems (ads) are resulting in a bureaucratic decision-making process that seems to defy scrutiny and accountability. this dissertation project will explore how injuries stemming from the use of ads transformed into legal claims by investigating conditions under which individuals can name as responsible and then blame the use of automated decision systems. understanding such conditions help us understand how legal consciousness is produced in the context of algorithmic harms. the project examines how algorithmic harms came to be understood as legal in nature or as legally claimable by looking at conditions under which algorithmic harms are perceived and transformed into legal claims. in addition, the project will examine the extent to which automation bias and perceived procedural justness interferes with individuals' recourse to law   naming and blaming automated decision-making systems:   analysis of contesting algorithmic injustice   although, algorithmic tools and artificial intelligence applications have now become a vital part of our daily lives, reshaping the way we live and the way governments manage public services, we know little about how ordinary individuals understand their justice problems and respond to them in an increasingly automated world. the central question in this study asks under which conditions individuals are able to name as responsible and then blame the automated decision systems in order to voice challenges through legal institutions? the primary aim of the dissertation is to further our understanding of the grounds that enable perception of injuries/algorithmic harms resulting from the use of automated decision-making systems (ads) and how legal consciousness is produced in the context of algorithmic harms. in addition, the study will examine the extent to which automation bias and perceived procedural justness (i.e., the tendency to assume technological tools as reliable and neutral) interferes with individuals' recourse to law.   to date, most of the debate on ads has focused on the systems themselves; not the people affected by them. few studies examine the operational contexts of ads (e.g., eubanks, 2018). although legal scholars draw attention to several problems such as due process (e.g., citron, 2008; citron and pasquale, 2014) and incompatibility with existing equal-protection jurisprudence (barocas & selbst, 2016; huq, 2019), and studies examining the accountability of ads raise serious concerns about the lack of accountability and the hidden bias embedded in these systems (crawford, 2013; kraemer et al., 2011; o'neil, 2016) these studies focus on the systems themselves. current literature largely does not provide empirical evidence of how the accountability problems they indicate manifest on the ground or their implications for access to courts. on top of the lack of transparency problems, the harmful effects of ads appear to be hidden behind the false veneer of technological infallibility. yet, the existing debate is dominated by top-down perspectives but the perspectives of individuals who are directly affected by these systems or the ways in which their experiences alter/affect their ability to claim legal rights remains largely unexplored.  crossing disciplinary boundaries, the study will draw upon insights of literatures on public administration, dispute transformation, legal mobilization, critical data studies, human computer interaction, procedural justice, and legal consciousness. data collection will consist of in-depth semistructured interviews, court opinions, trial transcripts, witness testimony and discovery materials of existing legal challenges involving the technologies of poverty management which includes ads used in disability benefits determinations, unemployment fraud determinations, and food assistance under the supplemental nutrition assistance. analysis will be conducted inductively using open coding via nvivo qualitative data analysis tool simultaneously with data collection to identify emerging themes and central patterns. analytical memos will be used throughout the process to confirm, refute, or modify codes as they developed.  the funds from the apsa doctoral dissertation improvement grant will be spent on travel costs associated with travel and related expenses to conduct in person interviews and document access charges to lexisnexis. documents access charges includes copies of trial transcripts, expert witness testimonies, and deposition transcripts. these types of document requests are beyond the scope of the university's flat rate subscription to lexis nexis. pilot interviews that i conducted indicates that some of the prospective research participants who are the named plaintiffs or class members in the lawsuit may likely be 'digital natives' or may not have access to internet and/or computer to participate in online interviews that are mediated by digital video-conferencing tools. if granted this funding is expected to improve the overall dissertation because it will allow accessing more documents and recruiting more participants and engaging with more in person interviews which can generate richer and higher quality data than the remote interviews via zoom due to the more conversational nature of the interactions.

    "cristian lenart": "  request for supplemental funding 1.overview i am requesting supplemental funding for my current nsf grant dms-1855592,new applications of combinatorics to representation theory and schubert calculus($200,000, period:  9/1/2019− 8/31/2022).   the  additional  funding  will  be  used  to  support  my  postdoctoral  associate,  khanh nguyen duc, between 1/16−4/15/2023. khanh  obtained  his  phd  in  september  2020  from  the  university  of  lyon  (france)  under  the joint supervision of two world-renowned experts in representations of algebraic groups and related topics:  nicolas ressayre and kenji yohara.  he had his first postdoctoral position at the university of magdeburg (germany), being mentored by petra schwer. he has been my postdoctoral associate at suny albany between 1/15−6/15/2022, being funded from my current nsf grant. during the time spent at suny albany, khanh worked with me on two projects:  one on certain combinatorial aspects of schubert calculus on flag varieties, and another one involving a combina- torial model in the representation theory of affine lie algebras called the (quantum) alcove model, which i developed with several collaborators.  the second project is described in more detail below. khanh and i made significant progress with it, including a critical step which prevented my progress before (see below).  the supplemental funding is requested to complete this project. the  mentioned  project  was  part  of  the  proposal  funded  by  my  current  grant.   the  goal  is  to realize  combinatorially  a  very  important  relationship  in  the  representation  theory  of  affine  lie algebras,  which  goes  back  to  the  kyoto  school  of  jimbo,  kashiwara,  et  al.   this  is  a  relation- ship between certain affine demazure modules and certain finite-dimensional affine modules called kirillov-reshetikhin modules.  interestingly,  the combinatorics  of the project,  which is based  on the alcove model, uses a newly discovered representation-theoretic version of the celebrated “quan- tum=affine” correspondence in schubert calculus (see below).  this project has important applica- tions to combinatorial models for kirillov-reshetikhin modules, as described in my grant proposal. 2.background on the project certain  lie  algebra  representations  (including  the  highest  weight  ones)  are  known  to  possess crystal  bases,  when  viewed  as  representations  of  the  corresponding  quantum  algebrasu q (g).   in the  limitq→0,  the  structure  of  a  crystal  basis  is  encoded  in  a  colored  directed  graph  on  the basis elements, calledcrystal graph[kas91].  the directedi-edgesb→f i (b) give the action of the kashiwara  operators(analogues  of  the  chevalley  generators)  asq→0;  here  theiindexing  the simple rootsα i are viewed as edge colors.  crystal graphs have various combinatorial models, and are very useful tools in representation theory. for  a  dominant  weight  λ  (of  finite  type  or  not)  andwin  the  corresponding  weyl  group,  a demazure  modulev w (λ)  is  a  submodule  of  a  highest  weight  onev(λ)  determined  by  a  borel subalgebra acting on an extremal weight vector.  the demazure modulev w (λ) has an associated demazure crystal, denotedb w (λ). kirillov-reshetikhin  (kr)  modules[kr90]  are  finite-dimensional  modulesw r,s for  affine  lie algebras, not of highest weight, which are labeled by a positive integer multiplesω r of the corre- sponding finite type fundamental weightω r .  in classical types we think ofsω r as a rectangular young diagram of heightrand widths, so i refer to the kr modulesw r,1 as single-column ones. in most cases,w r,s was shown to have a crystal basis, and the crystal graph is denotedb r,s . in [lns + 17], we showed that the so-called quantum alcove model, which i developed with my former phd student a. lubovsky in [ll15], is a uniform combinatorial model for tensor products of single-column kr crystals, for all untwisted affine types.  the quantum alcove model generalizes 1  the alcove model in my papers with a. postnikov and m. shimozono [lp07, lp08, ls14], which describes the highest weight crystals and demazure crystals of symmetrizable kac-moody algebras. i describe the (quantum) alcove model using the setup of a finite root system.  recall thequantum bruhat graphqbg(w) on the weyl groupw[fw04]; this is the directed graph with edges (1)w α −→ws α such that`(ws α ) = { `(w) + 1  or `(w)−2〈ρ,α ∨ 〉+ 1, whereαis a positive root,s α the corresponding reflection,`(w) the length ofw, andρhalf the sum of the positive roots.  the first condition gives the coverslof the (strong) bruhat order onw. given a dominant weightλ, the quantum alcove model inputs a fixed sequence of positive roots γ = (β 1 ,...,β m ) called aλ-chain;

here λ 0 is the 0-affine fundamental weight.  this result was refined by fourier-littelmann [fl06], see (3).  they proved that, in simply laced types, we have an isomorphism as classical crystals (discard the affine 0-arrows) between the crystal corresponding to the affine demazure modulev −μ ∨ (λ 0 ) :=v t −μ ∨ (λ 0 ), denotedb −μ ∨ (λ 0 ), and the tensor product of kr crystalsb:=b r 1 ,1 ⊗...⊗b r n ,1 ; hereμ=ω r 1 +...+ω r n , as in theorem 1, and we assume thatμis in the root lattice, for simplicity.  moreover, by [fss07, st12], the 0-arrows inb −μ ∨ (λ 0 ) correspond to the 0-arrows inbwhich are not at the end of a string of 0-arrows.  the arrows inbcorresponding to arrows inb −μ ∨ (λ 0 ) are calleddemazure arrows, and we denote the corresponding subgraph ofbbyd 1 (b). in the proposal funded by my current grant,  i formulated the project described below,  which would realize combinatorially the fourier-littelmann map. i start by noting that theorem 1 realizes the kr and demazure crystals related by the fourier-littelmann map in terms of the alcove model, as in (3); here we use the notation in section 2, and γ(ν) is aν-chain of roots. goal.realize combinatorially the fourier-littelmann crystal map, as the dotted arrow in(3).

 task 1: ccny team will further develop and update future projections for extreme heat, extreme wind, and extreme precipitation from cmip 6.0 at spatial and temporal resolutions relevant to pr and usvi using both statistical and dynamic downscaling methods.  projections will be delivered in usable formats to communities and public/private stakeholders, likely interactive maps and downloaded data demonstrating areas of vulnerabilities in decades periods of 2040, 2050, 2070, and 2090.  if information is readily available from the national climate assessment reports, ccny team will cure it and adapt it to pr and usvi using downscaling mapping techniques. this work builds from our previous climate projections works for the caribbean and new york city,, (y1-y3);   task 2: ccny team will provide usable information of vulnerabilities and resiliency of the critical and interconnected infrastructure as function of extreme weather events with emphasis on power-water interconnections.   2.1 the information leverages and builds from ongoing efforts (nsf crisp project), where resiliency of this interconnected system is being analyzed in lieu of hurricane maria.  the crisp effort focuses on island-wide analysis for pr.  under the noaa risa, ccny team will provide this analysis to the local communities' spatial scales exploring local socio-technical vulnerabilities.   2.2 furthermore, energy mitigation options for increasing energy demands due to air increasing temperatures and humidity will be provided at the community scales leveraging from recent previous works where building energy options were explored for the case of the city of san juan,,.  the options considered included efficient building envelopes, roof integrated solar pv systems, efficient air conditioning systems and white roofs.  these mitigation options will be expanded to other cities outside sju, and in usvi and will be consulted with communities and decision makers (such as energy bureau in pr and equivalent in usvi), to map pathways for action and implementation dealing to roadmaps for specifics mitigation milestones.     abstract:  we aim to accomplish the following specific objectives of the modeling component of the tracer sea-breeze and air quality modeling study:    to produce a series of replicable observations of summer sea-breeze and sea breeze fronts and resulting air quality in and around houston metro region during tracer field study in 2022.   to configure and execute an atmospheric and air quality modeling strategy that captures the urban effects as represented by land-cover changes and anthropogenic emissions of sensible and latent heat in the pbl for the summer season.     the impacts of increasingly frequent extreme weather events on energy infrastructure are becoming disruptive to the us society and economy. examples include the tropical storms ida (2021), sandy (2012), maria (2017), and harvey (2017), as well as the numerous heat waves across the us, and multiple winter storms including the 2021 texas storm. the widespread loss of power during these extreme weather events illustrate the significance of a science based and transferable approach for design and retrofit for resiliency of the energy infrastructure in the us. our science goal is to contribute to work that results in an energy generation and distribution system that maintains and/or rapidly recovers from disruptions, when exposed to damaging extreme weather events. there is urgent need for research that provides better understanding of the relationship between climate-change-driven extreme weather events and the wellbeing of the electric energy infrastructure.  a case in point is hurricane maria (h-maria) which took place in september of 2017 in puerto rico (pr), resulting in the destruction more than 55% of puerto rico's transmission towers, leaving a significant portion of the island's 2,400 miles of transmission and 30,000 miles of distribution lines nonfunctional for months. such power loss was accompanied by considerable human hardship.  the power transmission and distribution lines and systems are impacted by several factors when exposed to extreme weather events including mechanical loads due to high wind, soil moisture content and landslides, proximity to the trees and dense vegetation, and mechanical loads due to connected towers. these complexities of wind loads, complex terrain, and vegetation are more common in mountainous terrains, which is the case of puerto rico.  current knowledge and analysis tools are very limited when addressing the design and hardening of transmission and distribution systems.  we proposed to carry out a study to cover this urgent gap, specifically we propose three main activities: (1) develop a hybrid numerical-experimental approach for the predictive assessment of vulnerability of the electric power transmission infrastructure when exposed to extreme climate conditions. this will include multiscale high-resolution weather models coupled to validated cfd modeling of actual transmission assets, and scale-up to large service areas with machine-learning tools; (2) testing of the modeling framework in the context of at risk coastal and islanded communities, with puerto rico as first use case, and (3) in collaboration with local power companies develop a field test bed for model evaluation using novel instrumentation including strain gauges, accelerometers, and drone flights.  we will establish a unique field laboratory to conduct observations of weather impacts on representative transmission lines and their natural and built environments that include the complexities listed above.  we will test our damage models with field experiments and will develop approaches to scale up hardening strategies across the island.  the proposed integrated framework will result in significant value for planning and management of resilient power infrastructure assets in the us and elsewhere.

    "baris yoruk": "econometric analysis of the impact of covid-19 restrictions on alcohol consumption in the united states project summary since the start of covid-19 pandemic in the united states, alcohol consumption has increased considerably. however, little is known about the underlying factors behind this sudden increase. during the pandemic, majority of the u.s. states implemented several different policies to slow down the spread of the covid-19. examples of these policies include shutting down certain businesses that are deemed non-essential, closing schools, ordering people to stay-at-home, and imposing restrictions on large gatherings. recent papers show that these policies were effective in slowing down the spread of the virus among the population and reduced the movement and social interactions of individuals. in addition to these policies, almost all states implemented policies targeting restaurants, bars, liquor stores and other establishments selling alcohol for on-premises and off-premises consumption. these policies affected consumers, dictating where, when, and how they could buy alcohol. few studies for other countries based on cross-sectional surveys with small samples find that covid-19 restrictions decreased alcohol consumption for the majority of individuals. the existing studies that investigated the impact of covid-19 related restrictions in the united states focused on the spillover effects on social mobility, household spending, labor market, and housing market activity. to the best of our knowledge, no study provided a comprehensive empirical analysis of the causal effects of state level policies to mitigate the spread of covid-19 and that regulated the sale and consumption of alcohol during the pandemic on alcohol consumption in the united states. the proposed project aims at filling this gap in the literature and will provide the first empirical analysis of the impact of state-level covid-19 restrictions on alcohol consumption behavior during the pandemic. our empirical analysis is based on a newly available and underutilized data compiled by the niaaa on state level, monthly per-capita alcohol consumption of various alcoholic beverages. we propose to merge these data with the state level policies to mitigate the spread of covid-19 and that regulated the sale and consumption of alcohol during the pandemic in the united states. since different states adopted different policies at different times, our proposed empirical strategy is a difference-in-differences (did) model that exploits the variation in policy implementation over time and across different states. the results from this study will provide policy makers with new, important information not only about the effectiveness of alcohol control policies during the covid-19 pandemic, but also about how alternative alcohol control laws can be designed to maximize their preventive benefits.

    "fan yang": "  career: learn from where it hurts: building psychological flexibility into educational  intervention against misinformation   overview  the main research goal of this career project is to systematically develop and evaluate a  psychological-flexibility oriented educational intervention on misinformation. in pursuit of this goal, the  pi will 1) investigate the outcomes associated with psychological inflexibility toward misinformation, 2)  examine the prominent facilitators and barriers for individuals to exercise psychological flexibility  toward misinformation,  and  3) develop and test the narratives designed based on the revealed  facilitators and barriers in a psychological-flexibility oriented educational intervention on misinformation.  the mixed-method research design will be based on three integrative research objectives:  • utilize online survey to investigate psychological inflexibility toward misinformation and its  associated consequences such as information seeking, interest in open discussions, trust, as  well as individual resilience against uncertainty and manipulations.  • employ field research to examine how individuals in natural settings interact with  misinformation (attention, emotions, perceptions, attitudes, and intentions) and the prominent  facilitators and barriers for individuals to exercise psychological flexibility toward  misinformation.  • employ randomized experiment to empirically evaluate the psychological-flexibility oriented  educational intervention in helping individuals, especially vulnerable groups (e.g., senior  citizens), enhance psychological flexibility and achieve meaningful goals (e.g., meaningful  learning, individual resilience, trust, etc.) against the setbacks of misinformation.    my long-term educational goal is to engage individuals of diverse backgrounds in the effort of  broadening participation with the psychological flexibility oriented educational intervention. the pi will  leverage existing connections to engage local, national, and international students, educators, and  practitioners via a designated education website. the educational website will host a series of original  storybooks that contains all the narratives designed based on the research findings of this project, a  variety of creative educational activities developed to extend the storybooks into classroom, and a  podcast of interpretative discussions on the narratives for the general public audiences.    intellectual merit  this project will advance fundamental research on misinformation mitigation by 1) revealing  the profound consequences of psychological inflexibility toward misinformation at the individual and  societal levels,  2) investigating the prominent facilitators and barriers for individuals to exercise  psychological flexibility toward misinformation, and 3) building the “ground truth” regarding the efficacy  of the educational intervention on enhancing individuals’ psychological flexibility, and ultimately, their  reactions to misinformation. findings of this project will transform the current knowledge building of  misinformation and the existing “truth-based” interventions into a more integrated approach that helps  individuals harness and grow from this problem for meaningful goals.    broader impacts  the synergy between research and education in this project has significant broader impacts.  first, this project will train minority graduate and undergraduate students as well as non-traditional  community college students who are less represented in stem fields through their participation in the  developing and evaluating the psychological-flexibility oriented  educational intervention on  misinformation. second, this project will also broaden public participation in stem fields by engaging  individuals of all backgrounds, i.e., educators, practitioners, and the general public, in the effort of  enhancing their psychological flexibility toward misinformation and preparing them as more efficacious  information consumers of the next generation. third, the findings will be presented to policymakers,  practitioners, and scholars at professional conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. lastly, the  pi will work with the ualbany communication and marketing office, the questar iii boces in new  york state, and the mass communication and society division (mcsd) and public relations division  (prd) of the association for education in journalism and mass communication (aejmc) to promote  this scalable, transformational educational intervention locally, nationally, and internationally.

    "jon paczkowski": "  project summary/abstract 1   2  our current understanding of quorum sensing in pseudomonas aeruginosa has been modeled from decades of 3  research with laboratory  strains under standard growth conditions, but  recent research  suggests that this 4  canonical  model does not hold true in clinical  strains. we are interested in identifying how rhlr dependent 5  virulence gene regulation is altered in clinical strains. clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa have frequent inactivating 6  mutations in lasr, which is canonically considered the master regulator of quorum sensing. however, clinical 7  isolates lacking functional lasr are still  virulent. we seek to understand how lasr inactivating mutations are 8  overcome in clinical strains, specifically through upregulation of the transcriptional regulator rhlr. we plan to 9  identify novel regulators of rhlr in a lasr strain using transposon mutagenesis. mining of publicly accessible 10  clinical isolate sequence data revealed several common polymorphisms in rhli, the autoinducer synthase which 11  activates rhlr as  a  transcription factor. we seek to understand the role of clinically  evolved rhli variants in 12  activating rhlr using a  combination of phenotypic assays and transcriptomic experiments. we also  recently 13  showed that pqse, of the pqs biosynthetic pathway, physically interacts with rhlr and is required for virulence 14  gene expression. we discovered several pqse variants that cannot interact with rhlr and found that strains 15  expressing these  variants  have attenuated virulence  factor expression. we plan  to  introduce these  non-16  interacting pqse variants in clinical strains of p. aeruginosa to understand if disruption of the pqse-rhlr binding 17  interface also attenuate virulence in vivo. we hypothesize that progression of quorum sensing in clinical strains 18  proceeds through the activation of rhlr via  multiple noncanonical mechanisms. the long-term goal of this 19  application is to understand the plasticity of quorum sensing in clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, which 20  is critical to the development of antibiotic alternatives, and moreover, could lead to a paradigm shift in 21  our general understanding of quorum sensing in gram-negative pathogens. 22   23 ",
    "justin pickett": "project summary  project overview: research documents growing divides in fact perceptions among the public, including several salient examples in crime and criminal justice (such as perceptions of racial bias in the criminal justice system, of gun violence and gun control, of crime rates and criminal justice system effectiveness, and of the extent and causes of sexual harassment and assault). the current study has two goals. first, we draw on the multidisciplinary literature on fact perceptions to develop expectations regarding how motivated reasoning and \"value projection\" may link social order- and social justice-centered values to fact perceptions about crime and criminal justice. second, building on insights from behavioral economics, we develop a theoretical model (supported by pilot data) that distinguishes \"causal fact perceptions\" (i.e., beliefs about causal relationships) from \"statistical fact perceptions\" (e.g., beliefs about levels, rates, trends) and that explains how value projection may shape statistical fact perceptions by informing beliefs about causal facts. to test our theoretical model, we propose to collect public opinion data through two national surveys, one qualitative in nature and the other experimental and longitudinal. the first survey will explore the causal narratives that people use to explain disparities and statistics and how those narratives align with their values. the survey will use an open-ended response format and will inform the development of subsequent measures. the second survey will make use of a three-wave panel survey incorporating survey experiments to test our theoretical framework as well as treatments designed to reduce bias in fact perceptions. data collected from this project will be used to publish work that will be disseminated to scholars, educators, and the public.      intellectual merit: we will gather novel data bearing on the sources of divergent causal and statistical fact perceptions in crime and criminal justice. in doing so, we will advance scholarship in the fields of criminology and criminal justice, which have largely not examined the sources of criminological fact perceptions. as well, we will advance the broader multidisciplinary literatures on fact perceptions, motivated reasoning, and value projection by developing and testing a theoretical framework that distinguishes \"causal\" from \"statistical\" fact perceptions. taken together, we anticipate that our proposed research will spark new research and theoretical development across multiple disciplines.   broader impacts: better understanding the sources of divergent fact perceptions among the public (as well as potential methods for mitigating them) is crucial for the healthy functioning of a democracy, and our research will center on improving this understanding. our findings will be useful to policymakers and advocates who are concerned with the growing divides in public knowledge and scientific literacy. to this end, one experimental treatment will be designed to sever the connection between causal and statistical fact perceptions-a connection which, theoretically, results in statistical fact perceptions that are value-consistent but frequently false. we also anticipate specific impacts for the social and behavioral sciences and for members of the public. one is that our work will produce a rich public use dataset including a variety of relevant priors and factual beliefs across numerous domains in criminology and criminal justice. we will also disseminate our results through a public-facing website (cjfactperceptions.com), which will describe the results of the research and allow people to self-assess the extent to which their own values align with their perceived facts. in addition, we will publish summaries of our work in public venues such as the conversation and the scholars strategy network websites. we will also use our results to develop instructional materials for use in social science courses. such materials will be disseminated through the public-facing website as well as used by the pis in our own graduate and undergraduate courses.

    "shiguo jiang": "      project summary  overview  a  key  issue  in  the  spatial  and  temporal  analysis  of  crime  is  the  choice  of  scale. the overall  objective of this project is to extend the proposers’ pilot studies to investigate the impact of the  covid pandemic on the characteristic scales for different crime types across different cities. the  central  hypothesis is  that  the  characteristic  scales  vary  with  the  mobility  of  crime  targets  (i.e.,  victims). the rationale underlying the proposed research derives from the following premises: (1)  crime  involves  the  selection  of a target;  (2)  target  and  targeting  (offender)  have  an  interactive  relation that frames the occurrence and distribution of crime. in addition to the preliminary data,  the proposers are particularly well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their  extensive and successful track record of related research.  the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. aim 1: identify and compare  the characteristic scales of crime on mobile/immobile targets across cities; aim 2: test the impact  of  temporal  aggregation  on  the  characteristic  scale; aim 3: examine  the impact  of  the  covid  pandemic  on  the  characteristic  scale  of  crime. the characteristic  scale  of  crime will  be  derived  through point  pattern  analysis. anova  and  post-hoc  tests  will  be used to: (1) investigate  the  difference of characteristic scales for crimes on targets with varying mobility; (2) test the impact  of temporal aggregation on the characteristic scale. t-tests or wilcoxon tests (for non-gaussian  data) will be used to compare the characteristic scales before and during the pandemic. standard  regression  models will  be  used  to investigate  the impact  strength  of  the  pandemic  on  the  characteristic  scales of  crime.  time  series  regression  and autoregressive  integrated  moving  average model (arima) will be used to identify the potential lagged impact of the pandemic on  the spatial pattern of crime.  the  proposed  research  is creative  and  original because  it draws ideas  from  ecological  and  biological research and integrates the “first law of the criminology of place” and the “first law of  geography” to identify the characteristic scale of crime.  intellectual merit  the  contribution  of  the  proposed  study  is  significant because  it  not  only  develops  an  analytical  framework to identify the appropriate scale of analysis, but also sheds light on areal data analysis,  hot spot analysis/policing, geographic profiling, and policing response to pandemic.  the expected  outcomes – the characteristic scale as a candidate for appropriate scale of analysis – will address  the  modifiable  areal  unit  problem  (maup)  and  modifiable  temporal  unit  problem  (mtup),  shedding light on the scale issues in spatiotemporal aggregation.  broader impacts  findings of the proposed research will have important societal and policy implications. first,  the  spatiotemporal  patterns  of  different  types  of  crime  can  provide  local  communities  with  informed knowledge relevant to public safety. second, the characteristic scale of crime can  be used to (1) complement hot spot policing by serving as a candidate for the bandwidth (search  radius) of crime hot spots; (2) relate offender’s commuting circle in geographic profiling. third,  the relationships between the covid rates and the spatial patterns of crime can be used to improve  the policing response to the pandemic and potentially other public health crises.

    "mehmet yigit": "abstract:  rapid detection of the foodborne pathogen salmonella in food processing is of crucial importance to avoid outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, to ensure consumer safety and to prevent economic loss. detection and quantification of salmonella species in food samples is routinely performed using conventional culture-based techniques, which are labor intensive, involve well-trained personnel, and are unsuitable for on-site and high-throughput analysis. to overcome these drawbacks, we are proposing a nano-diagnostic approach empowered with novel synthetic biology techniques. the data will be analyzed using image analysis features of machine learning and results will be transmitted through mobile-app built in lab. the proposed test-kits will have high specificity, convenience, and rapid response. the proposed bio-(nano) technology offers the detection of salmonella under 4-hours and surpass the current microbial culturing method which can take up to 5 days. this is important for rapid and routine sampling to avoid potential cross-contamination or ﻿the spread of salmonella to other products. the data analysis through image-classification and mobile-app facilitated data transmission is important for taking immediate action and containment of disease transmission, thus preventing further health risks and economic loss. the proposed simple-to-use optical nano-diagnostic setup, as proposed here, offers a universal diagnostic template which can be employed beyond salmonella detection. therefore, there is potential for a broader application after the proposed diagnostics is realized.   abstract:  food adulteration is a mishandling practice of adding ingredients of lower quality, unsanitary, or even poisonous into the authentic food products; typically driven by economical motivation or negligible standards of product manufacturing. the result of such practices leads to unsafe product consumption, thereby, leading to potential short- or long-term health hazards for consumers. in this proposal, our goal is to develop an innovative machine-learning approach for the bias-free and rapid screening of food products and establish a rapid quality-control technology. the approach relies on the development and use of an optical nanosensor array which will be used to generate big fluorescence data for training our machine learning algorithms for the biomarker-free screening of (a) honey, (b) maple syrup, and (c) olive oil which have been subject to food fraud, safety, and quality control issues.
